Automated robotic systems, including cutting -  edge tractors and drone technology, can execute complex tasks with impressive precision,  decreasing the need for manual labor and enhancing   overall crop production. This  technological advancement illustrates how ML and automation can transform agricultural  practices, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient food production systems.  Current traditional agricultural practices face signi ficant challenges in resource  management and operational efficiency. Water usage is a major concern, with the  agricultural sector accounting for about 70% of the world\\\'s freshwater resources (Tabler  &   Chibanga,   2024).   The   rate   of   resource   extraction   regula rly   surpasses   natural  replenishment   rates, leading to   severe environmental   stress   and risks to   long - term  sustainability.  The constraints of space further exacerbate the challenges faced by traditional  agriculture, especially in urban areas and regions with   limited land availability. Vertical  farming, hydroponics, and controlled environment agriculture are innovative methods  aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity within these confined spaces. These novel  techniques show significant promise in overcomin g the structural limitations of\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  4  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  conventional farming, presenting more sustainable and effective food production models  for the future of global agriculture.  Urban agriculture encounters considerable obstacles in fulfilling the in creasing  demand for food while ensuring sustainability and efficiency. The advancement of  cutting - edge farming technologies has become essential to tackle these issues. Aeroponics,  a   method   of   cultivation   without   soil,   offers   a   promising   substitute   for   tra ditional  agriculture, suggesting potential solutions for food production in urban settings (Reza,  2024).  The   SkyHarvest   system   signifies   a   breakthrough   in   agricultural   technology,  incorporating sophisticated IoT sensors and machine learning to enhance plan t growth.  By employing real - time monitoring of critical factors such as pH, total dissolved solids  (TDS),   moisture,   rainwater   levels,   and   temperature,   the   system   offers   unparalleled  insights into plant health and growth (Reza, 2024). This method facilitate s precise  nutrient management and environmental control, potentially transforming strategies for  urban and backyard farming.  In conclusion, this study contributes to the ongoing conversation about sustainable  agricultural   solutions,   emphasizing the vital   r ole of technological   advancements in  conquering   food   production   challenges   in   urban   settings.   The   SkyHarvest   system  exemplifies the potential for data - driven, efficient, and environmentally friendly farming  practices.\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  5  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  Background   of the Study  Urban agriculture faces considerable obstacles in conventional soil - based farming,  largely due to the spatial and resource limitations found in city settings. The scarcity of  land significantly limits farming activities, pushing urban farmers   to seek creative  solutions that enhance productivity within restricted areas (Simos, 2024). These spatial  limitations challenge traditional farming methods, demanding revolutionary approaches  to agricultural production.  Backyard farming serves as one solu tion that enables urban residents to grow food  in easily accessible locations such as home gardens, rooftops, and balconies. This allows  individuals to produce food at home, decreasing dependence on large - scale agricultural  systems and contributing to loca l food security. Backyard farming addresses space  constraints while fostering resilient communities and sustainable consumption of food.  Water use is another major challenge for traditional urban farming methods.  Standard agricultural practices require sig nificant water resources, which creates a direct  conflict with the issues of water scarcity in urban areas (Machuka, 2023). The heavy  water demands of soil - based farming make these methods less sustainable in densely  populated regions where conserving wate r is crucial. Therefore, agricultural producers  need to investigate alternative growing approaches that make efficient use of resources.  Furthermore, maintaining soil health and fertility in urban environments is labor -  intensive and costly. The intricate e nvironmental factors of urban areas, including risks of  soil contamination and limited nutrient replenishment, complicate traditional farming  practices   (Al   Meselmani,   2024).   These   complex   issues   highlight   the   necessity for  adaptive, resource - efficient agri cultural technologies that can effectively fit within urban\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  6  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  environments, potentially through innovative methods such as hydroponics and vertical  farming.  Aeroponics has surfaced as a groundbreaking agricultural method that   tackles vital  issues in modern food production. This soilless technique suspends plants in the air and  continuously mists their roots with nutrient solutions, marking a significant progress in  sustainable agriculture (Woznicki, 2024). By fundamentally reth inking plant cultivation,  aeroponics offers a promising substitute for conventional farming methods.  The main benefits of this technique include faster growth rates and greatly  reduced water usage. Plants grown in aeroponics systems receive increased oxyge n  exposure, which enhances their nutrient uptake and metabolic functions (Møllerhagen,  2022). Additionally, the precise control over nutrient distribution allows farmers to  optimize plant health and increase yield potential, making this approach particular ly  appealing for urban farming scenarios.  Urban farms and vertical agriculture systems have progressively incorporated  aeroponics as a sustainable response to food production challenges. By facilitating  cultivation in limited spaces with minimal resource d emands, this technology provides a  transformative strategy for overcoming agricultural limitations in densely populated  urban   settings.   As   global   food   security   issues   become   more   pressing,   aeroponics  represents a technologically advanced and environmentall y friendly approach to future  food production.  Pechay   (Brassica   rapa),   an   important   leafy   vegetable   in   the   Philippines,  significantly contributes to urban nutrition and agricultural sustainability. Traditional  farming methods for this crop face considerabl e threats that impact food security and\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  7  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  agricultural productivity (Mahfiza, 2019). Challenges such as soil degradation, irregular  water supply, and vulnerability to pests and diseases pose major hurdles in pechay  cultivation, requ iring innovative agricultural solutions.  Recent studies have investigated possible remedies for these agricultural issues.  For example, urban farming methods that utilize upcycling techniques have shown  encouraging outcomes in tackling food insecurity. Ma hfiza\\\'s (2019) research indicated  that pechay grown from stems achieved a survival rate of 71% in repurposed containers,  emphasizing the potential of alternative farming strategies. Furthermore, experimental  research into organic fertilization methods, suc h as treatments derived from fish waste,  has exhibited promise in enhancing crop yield and improving soil quality.  The economic and nutritional importance of pechay highlights the necessity for  resilient   farming   practices.   By   adopting   cutting - edge   agricult ural   technologies   and  sustainable farming techniques, researchers and farmers can overcome existing challenges  and   boost   food   production   in   both   urban   and   rural   areas.   Ongoing   research   and  technological advancements are vital in supporting the agricultural   ecosystem of this  crucial vegetable.  Automation and smart farming signify a transformative shift in agricultural  methods, fundamentally altering conventional crop management approaches through  advanced sensor - driven monitoring systems. These sophisticated   technologies utilize  expansive sensor networks to consistently capture essential environmental data, offering  farmers unprecedented insights into the conditions affecting crop growth (Cifuentes -  Torres et al., 2023). By employing mechanisms for real - time d ata collection, agricultural\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  8  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  professionals can now accurately monitor critical factors such as pH levels, moisture  content, temperature fluctuations, total dissolved solids (TDS), and water levels.  The incorporation of sensor tec hnologies allows for immediate and targeted  actions, enabling farmers to dynamically optimize growth conditions. This forward -  thinking   strategy   significantly   reduces   the   risk   of   crop   losses   by   enabling   swift  modifications to nutrient solution and water man agement techniques. The advanced  nature of these monitoring systems shifts agricultural practices from reactive to predictive,  equipping farmers with data - driven insights that improve overall crop productivity and  resource management.  Machine learning, par ticularly through the use of computer vision and artificial  intelligence (AI), is transforming agricultural practices by enhancing the monitoring of  plant health. Automated systems that harness advanced technological capabilities can  effectively collect co mprehensive data on various stages of crop growth, allowing farmers  to apply fertilizers and pesticides in a timely and precise manner (Abbadi et al., 2024).  This   technological   progress   represents   a   notable   shift   in   agricultural   management  practices.  The   application of computer vision technologies enables the early identification of  plant stress and illnesses, thereby reducing the likelihood of widespread crop damage and  significantly boosting agricultural productivity. By utilizing advanced AI algorithms   and  imaging techniques via smartphones, farmers can gain real - time insights into crop health  with unparalleled accuracy (Cheein, 2024). These innovative strategies foster a more  proactive and data - driven approach to agricultural management.\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  9  HOLY CROS S COLLEGE  The   potentially transformative   influence   of   these   technologies   goes   beyond  immediate crop observation, promising to tackle significant challenges in global food  production. Through precise interventions and resource optimization, machine learnin g  and computer vision are becoming essential tools for developing more sustainable and  efficient agricultural practices. As technological advancements persist, the integration of  AI and computer vision is expected to play an increasingly critical role in o vercoming  global food security challenges.  Aeroponics serves as an example of innovative, technology - based solutions that  are urgently required due to the constraints of urban agriculture, such as limited resources,  space restrictions, and the shortcomings   of conventional farming methods. To promote  efficient and sustainable farming practices, this project aims to explore how these  technologies can enhance food production in urban settings, particularly in the cultivation  of pechay.  Review of Related Liter ature  Foreign Literature:  Aeroponics: A Sustainable Solution for Urban Agriculture  Aeroponics is a cutting - edge farming method that tackles modern sustainability  issues in urban food production. By suspending plant roots in the air and employing a  precise   spraying   system,   this   technique   offers   substantial   benefits   compared   to  conventional soil - based farming (Kyriacou, 2024). The distinctive method allows for  meticulous management of nutrient distribution, environmental conditions, and plant  growth parameter s, setting it apart from traditional agricultural methods.\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  10  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  Zero Acreage Farming: Modular Aeroponics System  The investigation of zero - acreage farming through aeroponics in urban locales like  Stockholm signifies a revolutionary appro ach to sustainable food production (Badhala,  2024). This method, which entails cultivating plants in a misty environment without soil,  drastically decreases water use and greenhouse gas emissions relative to conventional  farming practices. This innovative   strategy not only conserves resources but also makes  effective use of urban spaces such as rooftops, which can be pinpointed as viable  locations using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  Systematic Review of Technology in Aeroponics  A comprehensive revie w of 47 studies focused on technology in aeroponics  highlights progress in sensing technologies and applications from Industry 4.0. These  advancements improve precision farming by refining environmental control and nutrient  delivery, positioning aeroponics   as a valuable technique for sustainable agriculture  (Garzón et al., 2023).  Local Literature:  Urban Farming Using Upcycling Technique of   Pechay  Urban agriculture offers creative solutions to food security problems, especially  through sustainable cultivation practices of Brassica rapa L. Cv (pechay). This research  investigates upcycling strategies that enhance agricultural productivity within restr icted  urban settings, showcasing the potential for efficient crop management (Nacua & Solis,  n.d.). By employing stem replanting techniques, researchers have shown considerable\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  11  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  potential for lowering agricultural waste and enhanci ng crop regeneration. The  experimental results indicate a promising 71% survival rate for stem - grown pechay,  underscoring   the   significant   potential   of   targeted   agricultural   strategies   in   urban  environments (Nacua & Solis, n.d.). Ultimately, such progressiv e urban farming methods  not only tackle food availability issues but also foster sustainable agricultural practices,  creating a crucial pathway towards more resilient and resource - efficient urban food  production systems.  Sustainable Urban Agriculture in th e Philippines  Sustainable urban agriculture in the Philippines is an essential approach to  countering food security challenges. Innovative farming techniques, such as aeroponics,  provide promising answers for optimizing limited urban areas and boosting   agricultural  productivity. Although local literature is sparse, emerging studies imply that aeroponics  can   greatly   enhance   urban   food   production   by   maximizing   water   efficiency   and  minimizing land use. These methods are increasingly pertinent in densely pop ulated  urban centers encountering resource limitations (DA Press Office, 2021).  Challenges in Traditional Farming  The agricultural sector in the Philippines confronts considerable difficulties,  especially related to the depletion of soil nutrients and exce ssive water use in traditional  farming practices. Farmers in both rural and urban settings are progressively dependent  on chemical fertilizers to improve crop yields, which leads to long - term soil degradation  (Dupuis, 2020).

This  structured   approach   ensures   real - time   monitoring   and   automated   control   of   water  parameters, optimizing system efficiency.  Figure 2.5. Circuit Diagram  In figure 2.5 This circuit schematic illustrates an autom ated water management  system controlled by an esp32 microcontroller. Several sensors and relays are included to  monitor and control water quality and levels. The system contains several sensors,  including a pH sensor, water level sensors, and a temperature   sensor, all of which provide  data to an ESP32. Based on the sensor readings, the microcontroller controls particular  pumps via relays to modify the water conditions.\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  38  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  Starting with the pH monitoring segment, a pH probe is linked   to an analog signal  conditioning module, which processes the pH measurements before sending them to the  ESP32. The microprocessor monitors the pH levels and, if necessary, activates the higher  or lower limit pH sensor pumps via relay modules. These pumps i nject chemicals to keep  the pH level within a suitable range.  In addition to pH regulation, the system monitors water level. A capacitive water  level sensor monitors critical levels, and another water detection module provides further  precision. These sens ors transmit information to the ESP32, which detects if the water  level is too low or too high. If the level reaches a critical point, the microcontroller  activates the critical water level pump via a relay, restoring the proper water level.  The system als o includes a temperature sensor (DS18B20), which is wired to a  breadboard and interfaced with the ESP32. This sensor measures water temperature and  can be utilized for additional automation if necessary. Along with temperature monitoring,  the ESP32 control s the nutrients pump, ensuring that critical nutrients are provided to the  water supply when needed.  Each pump is powered by a 12V DC converter and turned on and off by relay  modules. The relays serve as a link between the microcontroller and the pumps, al lowing  the ESP32 to   securely control   high - power devices. The   wiring schematic exhibits  excellent organization, with power, ground, and signal cables clearly connected to ensure  reliable operation.\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  39  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  Software Requirements  To create   the mobile application for Skyharvest Aeroponics requires: Arduino or  ino code to run through ESP Wifi   module microcontroller which is coded for the system  to create network connectivity for the automation of the system and connectivity of  mobile applicat ion to the sensors.

Average Width of Leaves  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  By evaluating the date in table 3.11 the average leaf width of pechay plants  cultivated in both aeroponics and conventional   soil - based environments over a 28 - day  duration reveals minor discrepancies in growth trends. On Day 7, the average leaf width  in the vertical farming method measured 2.46 cm, marginally larger than the 2.38 cm  noted in traditional farming. This pattern per sisted on Day 14, with vertical farming  exhibiting an average leaf width of 5.79 cm compared to 5.96 cm in soil farming. By Day  21, the average width in the aeroponics system reached 6.81 cm, just under the 6.96 cm  documented in soil cultivation. Ultimatel y, on Day 28, the vertical farming approach  recorded an average of 8.14 cm, while traditional farming had an average of 7.85 cm.  Throughout the entire 28 - day growth period, the overall average leaf width for the  vertical setup was approximately 5.80 cm, ne arly equivalent to the 5.79 cm for the  traditional method. Although the outcomes are very similar, the aeroponics system  promote slightly greater leaf width in the final week, likely due to steady nutrient  availability and optimized environmental condition s which enhance plant metabolism and  growth.\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  66  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  Table 3.1 2 .

In the conventional farming method, the average leaf  length shows a consis tent increase, starting at 2.17 cm on Day 7 and progressively  advancing to 5.23 cm by Day 14, 5.67 cm by Day 21, and ultimately reaching 6.14 cm by  Day 28. This steady rise indicates a reliable, though moderate, rate of growth under  traditional agricultura l conditions. Conversely, the vertical farming method demonstrates  a more significant growth pattern. The average leaf length starts at 2.27 cm on Day 7,  slightly surpassing the traditional approach. However, by Day 14, the average length  spikes to 5.84 cm , reflecting a quicker growth speed in the second week. This rapid  growth trend persists, with the average leaf length hitting 6.13 cm by Day 21 and peaking  at 6.93 cm by Day 28. The increased rate of development in vertical farming is also  evident in the   average measurements over the 4 - week period, where traditional farming  achieves an average leaf length of 4.80 cm, while vertical farming reaches a higher  average of 5.29 cm.  These findings imply that vertical farming creates a more favorable environment  f or faster leaf growth in pechay plants compared to traditional farming methods. The  enhanced growth can likely be linked to optimized nutrient distribution and better  environmental control present within the vertical farming approach. This facilitates  impr oved plant metabolism, leading to more efficient resource use and, in turn, increased  leaf length throughout the 28 - day observation period.\r\n\r\nSKYHARVEST: AI - DRIVEN AEROPONICS VERTICAL FARMING WITH  AUTOMATED NUTRIENT DELIVERY AND GROWTH ANALYTICS  68  HOLY CROSS COLLEGE  CHAPTER IV  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  This chapter provides a   general overview of the study, the outcomes derived from  the analysis and interpretation of the data, and some recommendations for future  researchers to enhance and test the SkyHarvest: AI - Driven Aeroponics Vertical Farming  with Automated Nutrient Delivery   and Growth Analytics.

I NTRODUCTION  Over the past years, inventors, researchers, and technologists have continuously advanced  today\\\'s technology by automating services, optimizing human - computer interaction, and integrating  several systems to function as a single system. In particular, inco rporating technology into traditional  methods is innovative and revolutionary, allowing researchers and developers to modernize them. This  provides alternative ways to complete tasks using emerging technologies.\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  11  One instance is the implementation of technology in education. It is especially significant as it  digitalizes traditional methods, instances are utilizing soft copies of learning materials and employing  e - learning management systems. These advancements ar e being implemented and developed further,  providing   educational   tools   that   enhance   teaching   efficacy   in   educational   institutions.   This  transformation is evident in the Philippines, where developers are gradually integrating these  innovative solutions into   education, even making them accessible via mobile applications.  The utilization of mobile applications in the development of systems is now the standard for  upgrading systems from other platforms due to their portability. In classroom settings, such technology  can benefit students in various areas.   Using the mobile a pp, students can ask instructors questions  about school - related issues and attend courses via video call. This promotes anywhere, at any time,  access to education (Drigas & Angelidakis, 2017)  In accordance to that, a study by Demir and Akpinar (2018) showed the effectiveness of  utilizing mobile app in education of undergraduate college students. The results showed a factor that  this may promote academic achievement for students.  Central to these advancements is the conversion of traditional handwritten texts into digital  text in the educational field, particularly handwritten C++ code on students\\\' paper. C++ has been  described as a high - level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 and first  released in 1985. It is widely used for software development d ue to its effectiveness, efficiency, and  versatility. C++ supports both procedural and object - oriented programming paradigms, making it  suitable for a variety of applications (C++ Introduction, n.d.).  According   to   a   study   by   Ortiz   (2023),   learning   C++   is   an   excellent   starting   point   for  programming because it provides a strong foundation as a compiled language that converts code into  machine language. It also offers control over memory management, allowing for efficient code without  wasting resources. It   is ideal for large - scale projects, with a variety of libraries and tools that support  robust software development.  Consequently, C++ is introduced and taught extensively in computer literacy courses during  the first and second years of a student\\\'s academic program. During this period, students gain a  foundational understanding of the language, learning essential conce pts and programming techniques  crucial for their further studies and future careers in computer related fields.  Despite these developments, a gap still remains in the availability of educational tools and  resources. This gap presents a unique opportunity for innovation, particularly through the conversion  of handwritten C++ codes to digital text. Proposing a study   that aims to debug handwritten C++ codes  on paper is an idea that could lead to various solutions addressing challenges within educational  settings.  2.   M ETHOD   &   M ATERIAL  In this research study, the researchers used a quantitative approach in order to test the  development and functionality of HandSnap++, which is an Android application designed to debug  handwritten C++ codes through OCR and a compiler. This is because a qua ntitative approach allows  testing and validation of hypotheses using numerical data. Descriptive and developmental research  methods were applied within a quantitative framework. Descriptive research was used to gather  feedback about the effectiveness of th e application, while the developmental aspect was getting made  and improved based on ongoing feedback and testing. Purposive sampling was employed in this\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  12  research to select college instructors and students who are engaged with C++ programming, and  through this sampling, relevant data was collected against the objectives set in this study.  A structured approach to development based on Scrum, Agile methodology, guided the  development of HandSnap++. This was important for Scrum, allowing for a very iterative process of  development to divide the project into manageable sprints with focused and   clear development,  making the feedback applicable at every stage of development. In the \\\"Plan\\\" phase, the researchers  interviewed and surveyed college instructors and students about their user needs, challenges, and  expectations. This information gathered   by the researchers was then summarized to   develop a detailed  backlog that also included features and user storyboards, wireframes, application flowcharts, as well  as data base designs; hence the approach taken toward the development proved to be user and  educator - aligned.  The Design stage included developing an interface amiable to users and a solid database  structure. The researchers aimed at designing an intuitive and user - friendly layout for the system\\\'s user  interface. Both students and instructors would appreciate it.   Instructor feedback from the C++ was  included in the system to guarantee it met educational requirements. Simultaneously, the ERD of data  storage was created to hold data in the most efficient and organized manner possible. This stage was  essential to mak e the application work and ensure data integrity.  The Develop phase focused on the development of HandSnap++. Here, researchers were busy  creating the core functionalities. The front - end user interface was designed and coded. A database  connection was also set up and integrated with Amazon Textract for O CR to extract C++ code from  images. Furthermore, the system integrated a compiler for debugging and analyzing the extracted code.  Throughout this development phase, tools such as Flutter, XAMPP, and Visual Studio Code were used  to provide a smooth developm ent environment and to ensure efficient cross - platform compatibility.  The Test phase is where the functionality and performance of the application are evaluated.  Alpha and beta testing were both performed. The alpha testing was first done by the research team in  a controlled environment to catch bugs and to stabilize the ap plication. Following this, beta testing is  conducted to permit the application to be tested by a limited number of instructors and students for  usability and functionality purposes. This testing cycle is crucial for the improvement of the application  towar d the needs of its intended users.   A pilot test was conducted within the Computer Studies  Department of a private school in Region 3, Philippines, to evaluate its effectiveness and suitability  before applying it to other institutions.  Finally, Implementation is about the roll out of the application to its users for real time testing.  Through this, invaluable feedback was garnered by the researchers on how effective the application  will be in actual practice. From this stage of feedback , it was guided how further adjustments to the  application were made while ensuring that it was able to achieve the goal of the research study. Ethical  standards on informed consent, confidentiality, and voluntary participation during all stages.  3.   F INDINGS  The researchers conducted pre - survey questionnaires using Google Forms with instructors and  students from private higher education institutions and a state university in Region 3, Philippines,  allowing them to respond at their convenience. The goal was to   analyze the gathered data and gain a  better understanding of the proposed system, ensuring that it would be both efficient and effective.  3.1 Developing an application that addresses the insufficiency of student - to - computer ratio in the computer  laboratories by providing an alternative solution for debugging C++ codes using mobile devices\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  13  The figures 3.1 and 3.2   show   the result of the responses of instructors and students from various  colleges based on the pre - survey.  From the pre - survey of instructors, Figure 3.3 shows a mixed perception regarding the  availability   of   computers   in   computer   laboratories   during   the   pre - survey   among   instructors.  Specifically, 66.7% of instructor   respondents (4 out of 6) reported that the computers available are not  enough for each student. However, a significant minority (33.3%, or 2 respondents) indicated that they  do have sufficient computers, highlighting potential gaps in resource availability   that could hinder  effective assessment practices among instructors.  Figure   3.4 reveals that most instructors, 66.7% (4 out of 6), agreed that not having enough  computers makes it harder for students to learn programming, as hands - on practice is essential for  understanding coding and problem - solving. In contrast, 33.3% (2 instruc tors) felt that the lack of  computers does not necessarily prevent students from learning.  Figure 3.1. Students’ Pre - survey   Figure 3.2. Instructors’ Pre - survey  Figure 3.3.   Q1 (instructor): Do you have enough computers for each student in computer laboratories during  assessments (e.g., assignments, activities, exercises, or quizzes)?  Figure 3.4.   Q2 (instructor): Do you think the lack of computers in laboratories hinders students\\\' ability to learn  programming effectively?\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  14  In addition, Figure 3.5 shows that 50% (3 instructors) reported asking students to handwrite  code due to insufficient computers, while the other 50% (3 instructors) stated they have not done so.  This indicates that some instructors may require students to   manually write code not only because of a  lack of computers but also as a part of their teaching methods to help students learn the structure and  logic of coding without relying on compilers.  Correspondingly, in Figure 3.6, 16 out of 20 students (80%) reported being required to write  C++ code or code in other programming languages by hand because there were not enough computers  available. This aligns with the instructors\\\' experiences of resourc e limitations.  In Figure 3.7, it revealed that 19 out of 20 students (95%) feel they lack experience using  compilers because they spend limited time on computers during coding lessons. This reflects the  instructors\\\' concerns that without sufficient time to practice on co mputers, students may struggle to  understand   how   to   compile   and   run   their   code,   which   is   essential   for   becoming   proficient  programmers.  Figure 3.5.   Q3 (instructor): Have you ever required students to write C++ or any programming language code  due to lack of available computers during their assessments?  Figure 3.6.   Q1 (student): Have you ever been required to write C++ code or any programming language by hand  due to a lack of available computers in the lab?  Figure 3.7   Q9 (student): Do you feel that you lack experience using compilers due to   limited time on computers  during coding lessons?\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  15  Due to this challenge, the researchers were driven to develop an app that offers an alternative  solution for debugging programming codes, specifically in the C++ language, utilizing android mobile  devices and not with just computers as shown in Figure 3.8.  The goal was to provide a more accessible and portable way for students to debug their code.  This has been made possible through the use of Flutter as a development tool, allowing for the creation  Figure 3.8   A Screenshot of HandSnap++ Installed in   Android Device.  Figure 3.9.   Screenshot of CodeM in student Account\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  16  of the HandSnap++ app. The app can effectively compile and debug beginner - level C++ code, bridging  the gap in resources for traditional debugging tools. As shown in Figure 3.9, the app includes the  CodeM feature that allow students to write their code dire ctly in the editor.  Additionally, the respondents have agreed to utilize   such a tool   as this app if it is developed,  as it is shown in Figure 3.10 and Figure 3.11. With 100% of students saying they would use the app, it  shows that there is strong interest in this kind of tool. If developed, it could help many people by  improving the way t hey check, debug, and evaluate code in the classroom.  3.2. Developing an application that reduces the likelihood of overlooked handwritten codes, ensuring more  accurate evaluations of students\\\' work.  Figure 3.10   Do you feel that you lack experience using compilers due to limited time on computers during  coding lessons?(Instructors)  Figure 3.11   Q15 (student): Would you consider using an application that allows you to debug your code during  practice lab activities?  Figure 3.12   Q6 (instructor): When manually checking handwritten code, do you sometimes overlook syntax  errors, logical mistakes, or inconsistencies?\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  17  In Figure 3.12, it showed that 100% (6 out of 6) instructors agreed that manual checking can  lead to missed errors, which may affect the accuracy of assessments and hinder students\\\' learning. The  inability to catch these errors can result in students not f ully understanding their mistakes, potentially  leading to repeated issues in their coding practices.  In Figure 3.13, 11 out of 20 (55%) student respondents from table 2 experience   receiving   a wrong  score due to overlooked errors in their handwritten code. This finding underscores the challenges  instructors face when manually grading written assignments, as it can lead to mistakes that affect  students\\\' overall performance.  As a response to this challenge, the researchers   have   proposed an application that attempts to  reduce the likelihood of overlooking handwritten code errors to ensure more accurate evaluations of  student’s assessments. Utilizing the OCR as a first phase before debugging a handwritten C++ code,  this ensured th e accuracy in the evaluation process of instructors. This technology allows the  HandSnap++ to examine students\\\' handwritten code for syntax and logical   errors, not   just instructors.  This phase ensures the instructors have a tool that assists them in identifying subtle mistakes that are  often overlooked during manual checking.  Figure 3.13   Q14 (student): Have you ever received a wrong score due to overlooked errors in your handwritten  code?  (a)   (b)   (c)\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  18  During the development of the application, various handwritten C++ codes were tested to determine  the application’s accuracy in terms of extracting them. Some of it are the images in a, b, c, and e, under  Figure 3.14, the app demonstrated high accuracy in   extracting codes despite   having crossed - out   or  erased words. However in image d, its performance in extracting special characters and symbols used  in programming was lower by about 10%, resulting   in its   accuracy of 90%. To address this, the code  field remains editable, allowing users to correct any missed scans. Additionally, the app supports  multiple scans, enabling users to piece together code by scanning it in sections and combining them as  needed. Sy mbols such as semicolons, colons, question marks, exclamation points, quotation marks,  parentheses, brackets, braces, operators, underscores, vertical bars, and others were sometimes skipped  or incorrectly extracted, indicating a need for further refinemen t in recognizing special characters  critical to C++ syntax.  3.2. Developing an app that reduce the time instructors spend manual checking on handwritten C++ codes,  allowing students to receive timely feedback.  (d)   (e)  Figure 3.14.   Extracting Handwritten Codes of a Student  Figure 3.15.   Q5 (instructors): Does scoring handwritten coding assessments take a significant amount of your  time?\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  19  In Figure 3.15, it illustrated that 100% (6 out of 6) of instructors agree that manually checking  handwritten coding assessments requires an excessive amount of time. This overwhelming consensus  underscores a common frustration among instructors, who must   navigate numerous handwritten  submissions. The labor - intensive nature of this process can detract from the overall teaching experience,  as instructors may feel burdened by the volume of work and the need for meticulous attention to detail.  In Figure 3.16, it showed that 100% (6 out of 6) of instructors agree that the lengthy grading  process directly impacts their ability to provide timely feedback. This delay can have serious  implications for students, as timely feedback is essential for the ir learning and development. It allows  students to understand their errors, learn from them, and apply this knowledge to future assignments.  The excessive waiting time for feedback can lead to missed critical learning opportunities, resulting in  confusion   regarding their progress.  Figure   3.17 revealed that 66.7% (4 out of 6) of instructors believe that delayed feedback  significantly impacts students\\\' learning. This majority opinion highlights the crucial role of timely  assessment in the educational process.  Figure 3.16.   Q7 (instructor): Do you think the process of manual checking of handwritten code assessment of  students prevents you from giving timely feedback to your students?  Figure 3.17.   Q9 (instructor): Do you   believe the delayed return of students\\\' handwritten code assessments affects  their learning?  Figure 3.18.   Q12 (instructor): Do you think manual checking of handwritten codes takes excessive time  compared to checking digital submissions?\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  20  Figure   3.18 has supported these findings, showing that all instructors agree that grading  handwritten coding assignments takes significantly more time than evaluating digital submissions.  This agreement highlights a critical challenge in the current assessment p rocess. Manual grading not  only requires a detailed review of each handwritten submission but also demands greater cognitive  effort as instructors strive to identify syntax errors, logical mistakes, and formatting issues. In contrast,  digital submissions o ften facilitate a more streamlined grading process.  Due to these challenges, Figure 3.19 indicates that 16 out of 20 student respondents (80%) have  faced delays in receiving feedback on their handwritten assignments, while 4 students (20%) stated  they have not. This significant number suggests that feedback   on handwritten assignments often takes  longer than desired, which can be disappointing for students eager to learn and improve their coding  skills.  The Figure 3.20 further emphasizes this   concern, as all 20 student respondents (100%) agreed  that receiving late feedback on their handwritten code affects their ability to learn and improve. This  highlights the crucial role of prompt feedback for students. When feedback is delayed, students mis s  opportunities to understand their mistakes and make corrections before moving on to new material.  Figure 3.19.   Q5 (student): Have you experienced delays in receiving feedback on handwritten coding activities?  Figure 3.20   Q6 (student): Do you believe that receiving late feedback on your handwritten code affects your  ability to learn and improve?\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  21  To address these challenges, the   researchers integrated a digital scoring system in their  proposed application in addition to debugging handwritten C++ codes, aiming to reduce time spent on  manual verification using traditional methods. By utilizing the application, instructors can evalua te  students’ assessments both during their laboratory activity and after they have completed answers on  paper. The system allows teachers to instantly view compiled output for each student’s code, making  it easier to assess correctness in real time.   Under Figure   3.21, Image a illustrates the compiled result of  a student’s response to an assessment question, while Images b and c show class scores and detailed  reports of each student’s answers.  This approach solves the challenge of delayed feedback by enabling immediate score entry and  record - keeping. After students submit their handwritten answers, they pass through the system, where  scores are quickly recorded and instantly visible in the stude nt’s app account. This makes it easier for  teachers to spend less time on paperwork and more time giving feedback to students, thus maximizing  classroom productivity.  3.2. Developing an application that minimizes the loss of papers by recording activity sheets digitally  (a)   (b)   (c)  Figure 3.21.   User Interface of HandSnap++ that highlights the scoring system.\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  22  The Figure 3.22 shows an even split with instructors, 50% (3 respondents) saying yes and 50%  (3 respondents) saying no. This suggests that while some students struggle with keeping track of their  activity   sheets,   others   manage   to   maintain   their   submissions ,   reflecting   variability   in   student  organization skills.  In response, Figure 3.23 has shown 13 out of 20 student respondents (65%) reported that they  have misplaced or lost their handwritten coding assignments or quizzes, while 7 respondents (35%)  stated that they have not. This finding shows that a lot of stud ents faces challenges in keeping track of  their written work, which can lead to unnecessary stress and hinder their ability to study effectively.  In Figure 3.24, where 19 out of 20 student respondents (95%) indicated that they find it harder  to review for exams or quizzes without their previous handwritten activity sheets. Only 1 respondent  (5%) disagreed. This highlights the importance of having ac cess to past assignments for effective exam  preparation. Without these materials, students may struggle to recall important concepts or practices,  making it more difficult to perform well in assessments.  Figure 3.22.   Q10 (instructor): Have any students frequently reported losing their handwritten code assessment  papers?  Figure 3.23.   Q7 (student): Have you ever misplaced or lost your   handwritten coding assignments or quizzes?  Figure 3.24.   Q8 (student): Do you find it harder to review for exams or quizzes without your previous  handwritten activity sheets?\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  23  With having different role accounts in the application for instructors and students, as shown  in Image a under the Figure 3.25, students will have digital access to their scores and codes (Images b  and c). Each student has a digital copy of all their activ ities and other assessments, which serves as a  reliable backup if they lose any paper documents.  3.2. Developing an application that enhances student’s familiarity in using compilers, allowing them to adapt to  real - world compiler environments and bridge the gap between handwritten code and practical debugging skills  Figure 3.26 shows that all 20 student respondents (100%) agreed that writing code by hand is  more difficult than typing it on a computer. This highlights the challenges of manual coding, which  lacks the immediate feedback and ease of editing that computer - based coding provides.  Figure 3.26.   Q2 (student): Do you feel that writing code by hand is more difficult than typing it on a   computer  (a)   (b)   (c)  Figure 3.25.   User Interface of the HandSnap++ That Highlights the Assessment Report in Student Account\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  24  In   Figure 3.27, all student respondents also reported (100%) that they find it more challenging  to spot syntax errors when handwriting code compared to using a compiler. This indicates that the  absence of real - time error detection while writing by hand increa ses the likelihood of mistakes going  unnoticed.  The Figure 3.28 further supports this concern, as all   student respondents (100%) stated they  have struggled to understand their mistakes in handwritten code without the ability to test it in a  compiler. This lack of testing capabilities makes it difficult for students to learn from their errors, as  they do no t receive clear guidance on what went wrong or how to fix it.  When transitioning from handwritten code to a compiler environment, Figure 3.29 shows that  18 out of 20 student respondents (90%) faced difficulties, while 2 of them (10%) reported no issues. This  suggests that the shift from manual coding to using a compi ler presents challenges for most students.  Figure 3.27   Q3 (student): Do you find it more difficult to spot syntax errors when handwriting code compared  to using a compiler?  Figure 3.28.   Q4 (student): Have you struggled to understand your mistakes in handwritten code without the  ability to test it in a compiler?  Figure 3.29.   Q10 (student): Have you faced difficulties transitioning from handwritten C++ or any programming  language code to coding in a compiler environment?\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  25  In Figure 3.30, all student respondents (100%) agreed that more hands - on experience with a  compiler would help them debug their code more effectively. This reinforces the importance of practical  experience in learning programming, as hands - on practice with compilers is crucial for developing  coding skills and building confidence in debugging.  Correspondingly, Figure 3.31 indicates that 83.3% (5 instructors) believe that insufficient  practical experience with compilers limits students\\\' ability to use them effectively, while 16.7% (1  instructor) disagreed. This highlights a critical gap in the le arning process, emphasizing that familiarity  with compilers is essential for writing and testing code.  Figure 3.30.   Q11 (student): Do you think that more hands - on experience with a compiler would help you debug  your code more effectively?  Figure 3.31.   Q8 (instructor): Are students struggling to adapt to compilers due to a lack of hands - on experience in  the lab?  (a)   (b)   (c)  Figure 3.32.   User Interface of HandSnap++ Highlighting the Practice Mode in the Student Account\r\n\r\nMalaysia Journal of Invention and Innovation (MJII) Volume 4, Issue 4 | eISSN: 2976 - 2170  26  With these responses from respondents, the researchers developed the application which  mainly features debugging programming code,   particularly C++ language written in papers. This  mobile feature assists students who lack experience with compilers by offering a portable solution  while utilizing the paper coding still as their learning method. With the app’s Practice Mode (as shown  in   Images a, b, and c, under Figure 3.32), students can gain hands - on experience with compilers as they  try and practice their codes, helping them adapt more effectively and overcoming this challenge.  4.   D ISCUSSION  To assess the application’s   software quality, the researchers distributed an evaluation form to  selected respondents from private higher education institutions and a state university in Region 3,  Philippines. The respondents included instructors from the computer studies department a nd college  students enrolled in computer - related programs. Two (2) sets of evaluation forms were used: one for  instructors and another for students, ensuring that feedback was gathered from both perspectives of  respondents.  Table 3.1.   Overall mean for all the categories of ISO 25010 evaluation from All Respondents.  The table 3.1   overall evaluation from all respondents showed a grand mean of 3.69 across all  categories, indicating strong agreement from both instructors and students that the application meets  the ISO 25010 standards. This suggests that the application has successfull y passed the quality  assessment criteria set by the ISO 25010 model.  5.   C ONCLUSION  Therefore, the researchers conclude that the HandSnap ++ can serve as an alternative tool for  compiling handwritten C++ programming code, especially in situations where there is a shortage of  computer lab facilities. Using OCR in HandSnap++ improves the accuracy of evaluating handwritten  C++ codes, helping in structors identify subtle errors that may be missed in manual reviews. The app  provided a digital scoring system when checking handwritten codes, modernizing manual methods,  and it enabled the instructors to have timely feedback for students. HandSnap++ al lows instructors to  store students\\\' scores and scanned answers, offering convenience as students can access their  assessments through their accounts. By using the app, students gain hands - on experience with  compilers, helping them adapt to this while enhan cing their practical debugging skills. The results and  overall system evaluation rating, based on ISO 25010 standards, indicate that respondents strongly  agree the system meets software quality standards.

INTRODUCTION  In educational institutions, traditional printing services are frequently associated with several  operational inefficiencies, including long wait times, high operational costs, and frequent machine  malfunctions. These challenges are exacerbated by limited   access to printing resources, especially  during peak periods when students need to meet various academic deadlines (Ashmore & Morris,  2024). Additionally, according to Karovič et al. (2020), the cost of printing is still a major issue for  students, especia lly those with limited budgets. Short hours of operation and dependence on staff  further limit the provision of traditional printing services, ultimately stifling students\\\' ability to print  documents when necessary.  In order to tackle such problems, the proposed vending machine - based printing system offers  an innovative solution that seeks to make it easier to print documents. The system allows the students\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume   X | DOI: XXXX  to upload their documents via phone cable transfer/USB flash drive, or Bluetooth transfer. After  choosing the desired document, users can personalize necessary print settings, including the number  of copies, page range, paper size, and color options. The s ystem is based on a coin slot payment system,  where one pays the exact amount before printing begins. This self - service method reduces the  intervention of staff, thus increasing the autonomy and efficiency of students.  The proposed system has a number of significant benefits. First, it addresses the issue of long  queues faced by users in traditional printing services. By facilitating automated, self - service printing,  the system reduces waiting times significantly, making   it convenient for students to access and  allowing them to print documents at their convenience. By being able to upload files remotely and  print them without waiting for machine availability or staff assistance, students can effectively utilize  their time , particularly when working on tight deadlines.  This study aims to develop an innovative system   that   address es   the inefficiencies and  limitations of   conventional printing services commonly found   in educational institutions.   The  proposed system seeks to enhance service accessibility, reduce operational costs, and promote a more  efficient, user - centered learning env ironment through the integration of automation and self - service  technology.   Specifically, the study pursues the following objectives:  First, to design and implement a vending machine - based printing system capable of fulfilling  user print requests with high accuracy, reduced waiting time, and ease of operation.  Second, to evaluate the system’s software quality in accordance with the ISO/IEC 25010  standard, with emphasis on key attributes including functional suitability, performance efficiency,  usability and interaction capability, reliability, maintainability, a nd security.  Lastly , to assess the system’s user interface and interaction design using the ISO 9241  framework, particularly in terms of task suitability, self - descriptiveness, controllability, conformity  with user expectations, error tolerance, support for personalization,   and facilitation of user learning.  Finally, the study seeks to explore the scalability and applicability of the proposed system in broader  institutional   contexts,   and   to   assess   its   potential   long - term   impact   on   user   productivity   and  satisfaction.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  The researchers used a developmental quantitative approach to investigate the effects of the  Paper Document at Your Fingertips, innovating bond paper printing with a vending machine on the  users’ printing service experiences. The research objectives were f ormulated to systematically address  and provide insights into the research questions.  According   to   Rana   (2024),   quantitative   research   is   the   collection   and   examination   of  quantifiable data to verify the hypothesis raised in a given study. It takes a logical route, focusing on  theory testing, and is guided by both sides of the view. Quantita tive research determines specific traits  and meaningful differences to draw conclusions.

The  researchers conducted an assessment of the pricing of necessary components and equipment to  ensure cost efficiency and system compatibility. Various suppliers were considered to compar e  prices, quality, and availability of essential hardware, such as the printer, mini pc with touchscreen  display, Arduino Uno, coin - slot payment system, and USB reader.   In   budgeting and ensuring that  the components all meet the specified requirements for smooth integration. Subsequently, project  planning and task assignment help in offering a smooth developmental process. A   Gantt   chart was  created, including activities like purchasing parts, designing the system, testing, and completing  implementation. This aided the researchers in effectively planning their time   to meet   academic  requirements.  •   Designing Phase :   The physical frame of the printing vending machine is designed   to ensure   the  proper position of the machine\\\'s parts ,   like the coin slot, USB reader, touchscreen interface, and  paper output tray. This provides enhanced visualization of the entire structure prior to actual  construction. Further, PCB design is used to create the internal electronic layout, making  connection s between hardware elements, and facilitating seamless data communication between  the software and hardware.  •   Development   Phase :   The   user   interface   will   be   coded   with   Python   to   build   an   easily  understandable platform where users can choose print options like paper size, color, and number  of copies, ensuring that the vending machine can process file uploads, execute print commands,  a nd verify payments. It will also serve as a bridge, enabling communication between the Arduino  Uno and   the   system for the exchange of data smoothly. For hardware integration, the researchers  will construct the required parts, such as the mini pc with touchscreen display, USB reader, and  coin slot.  •   Testing Phase :   The researchers will conduct Alpha testing to identify and address the hardware  and software issues that will affect the overall performance of the system. The researchers will test  such important functionalities as document uploads, print execution, payme nt processing, and  scanning functionalities. All defects or inefficiencies discovered will be systematically debugged  and enhanced to ensure smooth running before proceeding to the next phase.  After Alpha Testing, the system will proceed to Beta Testing, which will be performed by the  selected users chosen through the simple random sampling technique. This technique allows for  the recruitment of respondents with relevant experience of dealing wi th printing services and use  of vending machines, to provide meaningful feedback.  •   Deployment Phase :   The system will first be deployed using Python to test its functionalities. It  will   test   how the system systematically has all its features ,   like uploading documents via phone ,  cable transfer/USB or Bluetooth transfer, printing execution, processing coin - slot payment, and  scanning operations function correctly. After completing software deployment, the system will be  installed at Holy Cross College, the locale of this study. Rea l - world testing will enable the users   to  engage with the printing vending machine.  •   Review Phase :   The feedback from the users will be gathered and examined by the researchers to  verify the overall performance of the system. The review process will focus on document  uploading via phone cable transfer/USB flash drive or Bluetooth transfer, correct printi ng  execution, and precise payment via   coin slot . Technical errors, such as printing delay or  malfunctioning hardware, will be noted. Necessary adjustments and improvements will be  implemented to maximize   the system’s   overall performance.  •   Launch Phase :   After successful deployment and evaluation stages, the system will be launched  formally for universal use by the intended users. The final release of the vending machine at Holy  Cross College will be done with appropriate promotional work to introduce the   system to the  users. The researchers will test all components and ensure users are informed on the use of the  system via user guides or demonstrations. Monitoring post - launch will persist in monitoring use,\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume   X | DOI: XXXX  resolving any issues that may arise, and making sure that the system performs well under actual  conditions.  This research involved 25 respondents, with 5 individuals chosen from each of the following  departments: School of Arts, Sciences, and Education (SASED), School of Business and   Accountancy  (SBA), School of Criminal Justice (SCJ), School of Engineering, Computer, and Library Studies (SECLS),  and School of Hospitality and Tourism Management (SHTM). This equal distribution ensured a  balanced representation across academic discipline s, providing a diverse range of insights relevant to  the study.  Table 1.   Distribution of Respondents per College Department  Department   Sample Size  School of Arts, Sciences, and Education (SASED)   5  School of Business and Accountancy (SBA)   5  School of   Criminal Justice (SCJ)   5  School of Engineering, Computer, and Library Studies (SECLS)   5  School of Tourism and Hospitality Management (STHM)   5  Total   25  The respondents of this study are the college students in Holy Cross College, Sta. Lucia, Sta. Ana,  Pampanga chosen through the simple random sampling technique. The researchers used this method as it  minimizes bias, enhances the sample representativeness,   and guarantees confidence in the generalizability of  findings. This technique provides an equal chance, and it avoids the use of personal judgment and decreases  overrepresentation and underrepresentation of some groups.  The study employed a structured survey questionnaire as the primary data collection tool to evaluate the  performance and user experience of the paper - printing vending machine. Grounded in the ISO 25010 and ISO  9241 quality frameworks. A 5 - point Likert scal e was utilized to capture respondent perceptions, ranging from  Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5). The resulting data were analyzed using weighted mean calculations  to identify user satisfaction levels and determine areas requiring further refinem ent in the system’s design and  functionality.  Table 2.   Descriptive Evaluations Chart per Likert Scale Point  Data collection for this study focused on evaluating the   functional suitability, performance efficiency,  usability/interaction capability, reliability, maintainability, and security of the   system , in accordance with ISO  25010 and ISO 9241 standards. Ethical considerations, including the confidentiality and privacy of respondents’  information, were strictly observed in compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (R.A. 10173). The study  objectives   were clearly communicated to participants, who were then invited to complete questionnaires designed  to assess the sys tem’s overall performance. Completed questionnaires were systematically collected and analyzed  to ensure data accuracy and completeness.  Prior to data collection, the study secured the necessary approvals from Holy Cross College to ensure  compliance with institutional regulations and guidelines. Respondents were informed of the research objectives  in clear and accessible language, emphasizi ng the protection of their privacy and confidentiality. The survey  instrument, developed based on ISO 25010 and ISO 9241 frameworks, was administered to gather comprehensive  feedback on the system’s performance metrics. The researchers reviewed the collect ed responses to validate the  data before proceeding with the analysis.  The researchers employed a five - point   Likert scale as a standardized instrument to quantitatively assess  respondents’ perceptions and attitudes captured through the survey questionnaire. This methodological approach  facilitated reliable and consistent data analysis, thereby enhancing the overa ll rigor and validity of the study’s  results.

Descriptive Evaluations Chart of Five - Point Likert   Scale  To have a better insight into the experiences and views of the   respondents, the researchers  employed a multi - dimensional data analysis by grouping the weighted mean scores into different  categories. A weighted mean score of 4.20 to 5.00 was included under a \\\"Strongly Agree\\\" response,  thus implying that the respondents   were highly satisfied with the performance, design, and overall  impact of the system. Then, a weighted mean score from 3.4 0   to 4.19 was designated as \\\"Agree,\\\"  showing that the respondents viewed the system in a positive light and serves its purpose. A sco re  within   this   2.60   to   3.39   suggests   that   respondents   neither   expressed   strong   satisfaction   nor  dissatisfaction. This group’s feedback indicates that the system neither significantly impressed nor  disappointed   them,   reflecting a   more   ambivalent   stance   towa rds its functionality and   design.  Alternatively, a score between 1.80 and 2.59 was   labelled   as \\\"Disagree,\\\" as the respondents were not  amazed in any function and were dissatisfied with the features of the system. Lastly, the score between  1.00 to 1.79 was   classified as \\\"Strongly Disagree\\\" because the respondents had severe problems or  difficulties with the system that led to strong discontent with some aspect of the system.  The researchers identified and analyzed the functionality of the software system, focusing on  how the system functions to make printing services available to users. To gain a better understanding  of the system processes, the researchers utilized various di agramming methods, such as flowcharts  and system architecture diagrams, to document and display the procedures between the user, the  hardware components, and the software. These graphs helped to explain the process flow, enabling  the researchers to grasp k ey functionalities and areas of possible optimization within the system.

Flowchart Model of the Paper Document at Your Fingertips: Innovating Bond Paper  Printing with Vending Machine  The document printing process flow of the paper vending machine is designed to be an  efficient, systematic, and   user - friendly service. It begins when the user selects the \\\"Print Document\\\"  function from the machine interface, triggering the process. The user uploads the intended file through  a USB connection, thereby providing the machine with information for printin g.  Once uploaded, the user selects specific print settings like color or monochrome printing, the  number of copies needed, and the paper size needed. This allows personalization according to the user\\\'s  needs and makes the system more flexible. After these cho ices have been made, the system checks the  format and size of the uploaded file to ensure compatibility with its printing needs. If the file does not  pass this test, due to improper format or size limit breaches, the system will ask the user to re - upload a  revised file. Only after successful checking does the user move on to the payment process.  The user must input coins as a payment for the service. The system then validates the  transaction. If the payment is incomplete or does not work, the system will ask the user to make the  payment again. It must be stressed here that if the user fails to inp ut the proper coins, the printing  process will not continue. This verification procedure ensures services are only rendered once payment  is verified, maintaining the financial sustainability of the machine. Upon successful verification of  payment, the syst em will automatically perform the printing procedure. Upon completion of the  printing job, the user gets the printed document and the file will automatically be erased.  3. FINDINGS  Following the development of the system, the researchers conducted a post - trial testing phase  involving selected respondents who had prior experiences with printing delays. During this phase, the  participants were guided through the   operation of the system to ensure a clear understanding of its  features and functionalities. The researchers provided necessary support and instruction throughout  the testing process, facilitating a seamless user experience and enabling the respondents to   interact  with the system effectively and without difficulty.  The results of the evaluation are presented in this section to demonstrate the system’s  readiness and performance after implementation. Moreover, after   conducting the ISO 25010 and ISO  9241 evaluations, the researchers computed the weighted means of the data gathered from the  respondents and used a five - point Likert scale to interpret the results. This approach aimed to  determine whether the respondents f ound the developed system effective based on its overall  performance.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume   X | DOI: XXXX  3.1 Letter - size (8.5” by 11”) and Legal - size (8.5” by 13”) Print Time Data  The researchers monitored the print time performance of the Brother DCP - T520DW and DCP -  T720DW printers, which were utilized for printing Letter - size (8.5\\\"   by   11\\\") and Legal - size (8.5\\\"   by   13\\\")  documents, respectively. The observed results are as follows:  Table 4.

The DCP - T520DW demonstrated faster average print times per page,   particularly for letter -  sized documents, with approximately 4 seconds for black - and - white and 7 seconds for color printing.  In contrast, the DCP - T720DW, used for legal - sized documents, showed slightly longer durations —  averaging 5 seconds per page for blac k - and - white and 8.5 seconds for color printing. These findings  highlight the influence of paper size on printing efficiency and suggest that while both models perform  reliably, the DCP - T520DW is more suitable for faster, routine print jobs, whereas the DCP - T720DW is  better positioned for tasks requiring larger formats. Overall, these results support informed selection  and   deployment   of   printing   equipment   based   on   specific   operational   demands   and   output  requirements.  3. 2   ISO 25010 Survey Questionnaire Results  Table 6.

INTRODUCTION  In the tropical Pacific, the southwest monsoon brings with it a torrential downpour and fierce winds to  the Philippines, typically lasting   from June to November. The country experiences an average of 20 typhoons  annually, with five of these typhoons causin g destruction each year   [1] .   Due to the effects of global warming,  weather patterns have become increasingly unpredictable, and intense   rainstorms may hinder the traditional  practice of drying clothes outside. Despite these challenges, hanging laundry outside to dry remains a popular  and effective method among laundry workers, as it is considered to be a simpler and low - cost way to dry  cl othes. Moreover, the process of sun - drying clothes offers an added advantage, as it has been scientifically  proven to be an effective method for killing pathogens, including vir uses and bacteria   [2] . Thus, this  traditional practice of drying clothes outsid e continues to be widely adopted in the Philippines, not only as a  cost effective alternative but also for its health benefits. At present, individuals face significant difficulties in  fulfilling their daily basic work obligations. This can be attributed t o the heavy   workload and the surge in  growing industries, which has made it challenging for many individuals to reach their intended destinations  on time. Fortunately, with the advancement of technology, solutions to these problems have emerged. The  latest   technologies have facilitated the resolution of many seemingly arduous problems, thereby making  individuals of all formats more comfortable and blither. However, despite these technological advancements,  certain challenges still persist.\r\n\r\n   ISSN :   2502 - 4752  Indonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci , Vol.   99 , No.   1 ,   Month 20 99 :   1 - 1 x  2  2.   METHOD  The res earchers utilized a quasi - experimental quantitative approach to investigate   the effects of  DrySense, a smart clothesline system, on people\\\'s daily laundry routine. The research objectives were aimed  at discovering pertinent answers to the research question s.   Q uantitative research is a structured methodology  for obtaining and interpreting numerical data from either a small or large population. This approach  emphasizes objective measurements and computational analysis, including mathematical and statistical  m anipulation of data from surveys, polls, and questionnaires. It seeks to evaluate the results based on a  specific population.  The respondents for the study are the people who have an experience in laundry works within Arayat,  Pampanga. The researchers ut ilized purposive sampling from non - probability sampling when researchers  used their judgment in selecting samples in a given population to respond in their surveys.  The researchers in this study have identified and selected the categories of Functional S uitability,  Usability, Reliability, Portability, and Maintainability from the ISO/IEC 25010 standard to guide their  evaluation of the software system\\\'s quality attributes. This approach allowed the researchers to utilize a well -  defined and established fram ework for evaluating the system\\\'s performance and quality characteristics in a  structured manner.  The researchers employed a survey to gather data on the performance, dependability, and usability of  DrySense, a Smart Clothesline System. The researchers   ensured that ethical guidelines were followed to  safeguard the privacy   and confidentiality   of the respondents\\\' data, in accordance with the provisions of the  Data Privacy Act of 2012 (R.A. 10173). The study\\\'s objectives and goals were   clearly   explained   to   the  participants,   and   questionnaires were distributed to gather data on their responses. The researchers then  collected the completed questionnaires to analyze the data gathered in the study.  In order to analyze and assess the system\\\'s functionality   and usefulness, the researchers calculated the  frequency and weighted mean of the data they had gathered from the respondent. Then, using these findings,  descriptive evaluations that are adapted from the Likert scale — which ranges from strongly agree to str ongly  disagree — are   interpreted.  The weighted mean is calculated using the formula:  𝑥 ̅ 𝜔   =   ( 𝑆𝐴 ∗ 4 ) + ( 𝐴 ∗ 3 ) + ( 𝐷 ∗ 2 ) + ( 𝑆𝐷 ∗ 1 )  10   Where:  SA   =   Strongly   Agree  A = Agree  D =   Disagree  SD =   Strongly   Disagree  Table.1 Descriptive   Evaluations   Chart   per   Likert   Scale   Point   used to   E valuate DrySense  Weighted   Mean   Point   Scale   Descriptive   Interpretation  3.01 -   4.00   4.00   Strongly   Agree  2.01   -   3.00   3.00   Agree  1.01   -   2.00   2.00   Disagree  0.01   -   1.00   1.00   Strongly   Disagree\r\n\r\n  Paper’s should be the fewest possible   that accurately describe   …   (First Author)  3  Figure 1 : Agile Methodology Framework   (retrieved from:   https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598 - 024 -  78613 - x )  Researchers used the agile development methodology which divides the activities into iterations in  the software and hardware system as they develop the entire system o f the DrySense Sma rtline System .  Initially, researchers collected information that is required in the development of the system. Researchers  implemented the design of the system based upon the collected information gathered. After the final  development of the system, the re searchers implemented the developed system to test the functionalities and  to improve and maintain the found problems in the system.  The researchers identified and analyzed the functionality of the software system which is the  DrySense Smartline   Web   Application.   The   researchers   used   different diagramming techniques to understand  how the system   functions.

INTRODUCTION  Swine production is the largest livestock and poultry sector in the Philippines, with a substantial market  value of P191 billion. It   plays a vital role in ensuring food security by providing approximately 60% of the  annual meat consumption for Filipinos. In global rankings, the Philippine swine industry stands at seventh  place in terms of pork production and the number of breeding sows   [1].  Nevertheless, piggery owners in the Philippines grapple with a significant challenge   -   the constant specter  of swine flu, a respiratory disease caused by the type A influenza virus that periodically leads to pig influenza  outbreaks. A recent incident   in Sta. Maria, Sta. Ana, Pampanga, where 30 pigs succumbed to swine flu, serves  as a stark reminder of the perilous combination of the Philippines\\\' climate and the ease with which this virus  can spread. The unfortunate consequence of insufficient monitori ng and delayed care was an alarming increase\r\n\r\n   ISSN :   2502 - 4752  Indonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci ,   Vol.   99 , No.   1 ,   Month   20 99 :   1 - 1x  2  in pig mortality. The ripple effect of this loss extends to the potential infection of the surviving pigs, thus  amplifying the crisis.  And in the tropical climate of the Philippines, characterized by humidity r anging from 71 to 85 percent  and a consistent average temperature of 26.6 degrees Celsius throughout the year, a yearly increase of 0.65  degrees Celsius has been observed [2]. This warming trend exacerbates the susceptibility of pigs to heat stress,  which   compromises their internal defense mechanisms and heightens their vulnerability to infections.  Furthermore, climate projections suggest that temperatures are expected to rise by 0.9 to 1.1 degrees Celsius  in 2020 and 1.8 to 2.2 degrees Celsius in 2050, as   per a study by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and  Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) on climate change in the Philippines [3].  The impact of this heat stress on pig production during the summer season is a significant challenge that  af fects various aspects such as growth rates and reproduction. In response to these challenges, our research  aims to develop a comprehensive system that integrates real - time monitoring of pig health and environmental  conditions to effectively prevent heat st ress and improve overall piggery management.   H ere are the key  components and features of the comprehensive system designed to address heat stress and enhance piggery  management:     The system incorporates sensors to monitor vital parameters such as pig body t emperature, humidity  levels, and air quality in the piggery environment. Real - time data collection allows continuous  monitoring of potential heat stress indicators and environmental conditions that may impact pig health  and well - being.     The system is progra mmed to detect variations in pig body temperature that indicate potential heat  stress. Upon detecting such variations, the system automatically alerts piggery owners or caretakers  through a mobile application, providing timely notifications to take necessa ry actions.     To mitigate heat stress, the system integrates with the piggery\\\'s ventilation system. Upon receiving an  alert or detecting heat stress indicators, the system initiates the ventilation system to regulate  temperature and improve airflow within th e pig enclosures, creating a more comfortable environment  for the pigs.     The system includes a user - friendly mobile application that allows owners or caretakers to access real -  time   sensor   data   remotely.   Through   the   mobile   app,   users   can   monitor   pig   health   m etrics,  environmental conditions, and receive alerts or notifications regarding heat stress or other critical  issues.     In addition to monitoring and alerting functions, the system incorporates automation for pig feeding  and waste management. Automated feedi ng systems ensure consistent and timely feeding schedules,  promoting optimal nutrition management for the pigs. The system also includes mechanisms for  automated removal of pig feces, enhancing hygiene and waste management practices within the  piggery. The   proposed system also includes a diary log feature for documenting pig information,  including their names, genders, and ages. The system then automatically tracks the pigs\\\' daily aging  progression.  This overarching objective of this research is to introduc e a smart piggery using mobile application, an  innovative system integrating pig monitoring, automated feeding, and ventilation control, all accessible via  a mobile application. Specific goals include monitoring pig weight, body temperature, environmental  conditions, and ammonia levels in pig feces. The study also focuses on automating pig feeding, cage  cleaning, and piggery ventilation while managing daily dietary requirements, treats, and supplements. The  mobile application aims to provide control and acc ess to sensor data, with a particular emphasis on assessing  the system\\\'s performance and usability, aligned with ISO/IEC 25010 standards.  And the potential beneficiaries of this research are multifaceted. Piggery owners can expect improved  monitoring capab ilities and more efficient management, including real - time health and environmental data,  automated feeding, and ventilation control   [12] . Consumers, on the other hand, stand to gain from reduced  risks associated with purchasing unhealthy pigs from piggery   operations or markets   [13] . Moreover,  students can use this research as a practical case study of implementing a Smart Piggery with hog  monitoring and ventilation systems using mobile application, deepening their understanding of IoT  applications   [14] . Fi nally, future researchers looking to advance this technology will find a valuable local  review of related literature in this study   [15] .\r\n\r\nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci   ISSN:   2502 - 4752     Development of Hog Monitoring with Automated   Feeding Machine and Ventilation System using Mobile  Application. Presented at the 5th International Conference on Automation, Mechatronics, and Robotics, 27  October 2023.   ( Grosby A. dela Cruz )  3  The research\\\'s focus centers on piggery automation, particularly targeting feeding and ventilation  processes and hog mo nitoring. It encompasses the development of a mobile application that permits users  to manage individual hogs, offering detailed histories accessible through logs. The application facilitates  setting feeding schedules and manual sprinkler control. The syst em incorporates ammonia gas sensors  (MQ137) to monitor cage ammonia levels and Contactless Temperature Sensor Modules (MLX90614ESF)  for tracking pig body temperature. Pig weight is monitored using load cells, while height is measured via  ultrasonic sensors . Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT), the system collects and relays data through a  web server, rendering it accessible through the mobile application   [23] . The system operates on a 220 AC  power supply without backup power. The study focuses on select ed piggeries in the Municipality of Sta.  Ana and Candaba, Pampanga, which use cage - like housing. However, it does not encompass an accounting  system for hog production and is exclusively designed for Android platform compatibility for mobile  application ac cess   [24] .  2.   METHOD  This research project employed a quantitative research design to quantify responses from the study  participants.

The study\\\'s overarching aim was to demonstrate the tangible  benefits of the Smart Piggery using mobile application, particularly for piggery farmers. To achieve this, data  were gathere d through surveys and questionnaires.  Using the mentioned statistical treatment, the use of Agile development methodology in the development  process of the Smart Piggery system using mobile application played a crucial role in ensuring the systematic  and   functional integration of both the mobile application and the automated hardware components. This  methodology is characterized by its iterative and incremental approach, which proved to be highly beneficial  in achieving a constructive and advantageous outc ome for the project.  H ere are some key aspects and benefits of using Agile methodology in the development of the Smart Piggery  system:     Iterative   Development:   Agile   methodology   emphasizes   iterative   development   cycles,   where  functionalities are developed, te sted, and refined in short iterations known as sprints. This iterative  approach allowed the development team to continuously improve and refine the system based on  feedback and evolving requirements.     Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile methodology promotes   flexibility and adaptability to changing  requirements and priorities. As the project progressed, adjustments and enhancements could be easily  incorporated into the development process, ensuring that the final product met the stakeholders\\\' needs  effectivel y.     Collaboration and Communication: Agile methodologies prioritize collaboration and communication  within cross - functional teams. This facilitated close coordination between developers, designers,  testers, and stakeholders, enabling rapid decision - making a nd alignment of objectives throughout the  development lifecycle.     User - Centric Design: Agile development places a strong emphasis on user feedback and involvement  throughout the development process.

The adoption of Agile development methodology in developing the Smart Piggery system contributed  significantly to its success by promoting iterative improvement, flexibility, collaboration, user - centric design,  continuous integration, and incremental delivery of value. These aspects collectively ensured a systematic and  functional integration of the   mobile application and automated hardware, resulting in a constructive and  advantageous outcome for the project   [16] . This chapter provides an insight into the methods employed to  obtain research data, detailing the instruments and strategies used in devel oping software and hardware that  met the specific needs of piggery owners   [17] . Additionally, it delves into the instruments and strategies  implemented to assess the system\\\'s effectiveness in delivering the required features for the organization   [18] .  Usin g the Scrum Agile methodology, the research project necessitated extensive laboratory work,  predominantly in the preparation and development of devices essential for its completion, in addition to hands -  on activities conducted in a computer laboratory for   mobile application development   [19] .  To conduct a comparative analysis, the researcher employed a comparative study approach, aimed at  identifying, analyzing, and elucidating the similarities and disparities between manual processes and the  utilization of   a Smart Piggery system   [20] . As a result, data were collected from piggery owners regarding  different aspects of the processes involved in feeding, growing, and monitoring pigs.  The research design encompassed several stages, starting with the structural d esign of the project,  determining the components essential for creating the hardware system, designing the mobile application  software, and culminating in the evaluation of test results   [21] . This comprehensive methodology was designed  to ensure the seamle ss development and assessment of the Smart Piggery system.  Table1. Resondpondents  Piggery Farmers   Number of Respondents  Sta. Ana, Pampanga   5  Candaba, Pampanga   5  Total   10  Data collection for this study was conducted through surveys, with the primary   data - gathering tool  being questionnaires. These questionnaires were carefully designed to ensure the accurate acquisition of  information from the respondents. The questions posed to participants focused on various aspects of the  research project, including   its functionality, reliability, user satisfaction, ease of use, and a comparative analysis  of the manual processes versus the Smart Piggery system using mobile application.  The research instrument comprised two key questionnaires: an ISO 25010 - adapted que stionnaire and  a computer system usability questionnaire. The Likert scale, a widely employed tool for ranking the level of  agreement with a statement, was used to gauge participants\\\' responses. This scale ranged from (1) \\\"Very Poor\\\"  to (5) \\\"Excellent,\\\" wi th (3) serving as the neutral or average option. This methodology allowed for a  comprehensive assessment of the research project\\\'s various dimensions and provided valuable insights into the  respondents\\\' perceptions and experiences.  Table 2 .   Interpretation   of Dichotomous Questions  Likert Scale Value   Interpretation  5   EXCELLENT  4   GOOD  3   AVERAGE  2   POOR  1   VERY POOR  To gather the essential data for this research project, the researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis  of credible sources, including   thesis papers, journals, articles, and research papers from both local and  international publications. These sources served as a foundation for understanding the topic and framing the  research within the existing body of knowledge.  In addition to the analy sis of existing literature, the researchers followed a structured process for data  collection from the Smart Piggery system. This process entailed several key steps:     Formulation of Questionnaire: The first step involved creating a well - crafted questionnai re that  included a range of technical and non - technical questions. These questions were designed to validate  and substantiate the research findings.\r\n\r\nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci   ISSN:   2502 - 4752     Development of Hog Monitoring with Automated   Feeding Machine and Ventilation System using Mobile  Application.

( Grosby A. dela Cruz )  5     Validation of Questionnaires: In the second step, the questionnaires were subjected to a rigorous  validation process. Experienced validators ensured that the questions were clear, pertinent, and  capable of eliciting the desired information.     Distribution to Respondents: The third step involved the dissemination of the questionnaires to the  chosen respon dents. This stage allowed the researchers to accumulate concrete evidence to support  their study.     Throughout the data collection process, the researchers adhered to ethical protocols, ensuring the  confidentiality and protection of the respondents\\\' data and   privacy. This compliance with ethical  standards aligns with the National Privacy Commission\\\'s R.A. 10173 Chapter 3 - Section 11, which  outlines the principles governing the processing of personal information, emphasizing transparency,  legitimate purpose, an d proportionality.  The collected data from the questionnaires was then analyzed using a combination of Frequency and  weighted mean. These analytical tools allowed the researchers to derive meaningful insights from the  responses. The findings were subsequen tly used to make descriptive assessments based on the Likert scale,  which ranged from \\\"excellent\\\" to \\\"very poor.\\\" This systematic approach aided in summarizing the survey  questionnaire answers effectively.  The researchers employed the Likert Scale, utilizi ng a five - point format, to interpret the results of the  survey questionnaire. This method provided a structured and reliable means of quantifying respondents\\\'  perceptions and opinions, contributing to the depth and rigor of the research project.  Weighted   Mean:  WM   =   ( 𝐸 ∗ 5 ) + ( 𝐺 ∗ 4 ) + ( 𝐴 ∗ 3 ) + ( 𝑃 ∗ 2 ) + ( 𝑉𝑃 ∗ 1 )  𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙   𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠   (1)  Where:  EXCELLENT, GOOD, AVERAGE, POOR, VERY POOR  Table 3.

To determine the system\\\'s level of utility, reliability, usability, and maintainability, the researchers  computed the weighted mean and examined the findings. The weighted mean was then split into five   categories  by the researchers, with a weighted mean of 4.01 to 5.00 signifying \\\"Excellent,\\\" which means that the  respondents believed the system created was extremely acceptable. The respondents\\\' \\\"Good\\\" response, which  falls between the ranges of 3.01 to   4.00, shows that they believe the system to be in working order. The  responses from the respondents fell between 2.01 to 3.00, which is the \\\"Average\\\" range. The \\\"Poor\\\" response,  which has a range of 1.01 to 2.00, means that the respondents don\\\'t agree with   the system\\\'s development since  some of its elements are inconsistent. Finally, a score between 0.01 and 1.00 indicates \\\"Very Poor,\\\" which  means that the respondents disagree with certain aspects of the system.  The Agile approach is a style of project mana gement that divides a project into stages. It entails  ongoing engagement with stakeholders as well as continual development at each level   [25] . When the job  begins, teams go through a cycle of planning, execution, and evaluation   [26] .  Seven phases of Agile   Designs were used by the researcher in developing the project “Smart Piggery  Pig Monitoring with Automated Feeding and Ventilation System using Mobile Application”, Seven phases  include the following: Planning, Design, Develop, Testing, Deployment of the   system and hardware, Review,  Maintenance, and execution of the project. This methodology is very easy to understand as this method can go  back like a cycle for improvement and revisions of the project   [27] . The system used a hardware and software  for the s ensors/modules to be automated.\r\n\r\n   ISSN :   2502 - 4752  Indonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci ,   Vol.   99 , No.   1 ,   Month   20 99 :   1 - 1x  6  (a)   (b)  Figure 1.

INTRODUCTION  Managing the customer value (CV) is the top one initiative to ensure the sustainability of  firms’ profitability, both shor t and long term of performances, as mentioned by   recent scholars such  as   Ali a nd Shabn (2024),   Amendah,   et al.   (2023), Bauer and Jannach   (2021), and many more .   It is  critical to understand and sustain the CV as well as business profitability, where it is important to a  lifetime of business survival. Recently, Eileen (2008) noted tha t to maximise long - term returns of the  company, customer’s value must be managed so as to move in the same direction as customer  profitability. Berman and Evans (2007) have discussed some issues on profitability which included  how the business can best ser ve the customers while retaining fair profits; how the business stand out  in a highly competitive environment where consumers have so many choices; and how the business  grow up their business while retaining a core of loyal customers. Thereby, customer is   a source of CV  and profitability where they have power to revolutionize their relationships to the business (Fabel et  al., 2008) and because of consequences of consumers intensely value - oriented, even more than in the  recent past (Janiak ,   2009).\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   |   DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849388  8  Managing   customer is important for retail business such as hypermarket store because of  many reasons, but mostly related to the business profitability. Scholars like Hamit (2011); Peter (2010);  Fader (2009); Epstein ,   et al. (2008);   Gilbert (2007);   Berger ,   et al. (2 006); Adams (2005); Ching, et al.  (2004); Bell ,   et al.   (2002); Berger and Nasr (1998), and many more concern the important contribution  of CV toward business profitability.   In principles,   c ustomer is an asset to the business as described by  Gupta and Lehma nn (2003) and for that, the business must know how to value their customers that  contributes their business performance (Gupta ,   et al.   2004). In this way, Glady , et al.   (2009) stressed  that customers are important assets to the business that must have to b e precisely valuated. From the  research work of these scholars, CV is summarized as an important factor that must be evaluated,  mostly by applying the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) model and approach.  Since the CLV has been introduced to the field in the 1 930s especially on marketing/retailing  research, a multitude of CLV approaches have emerged, with variation in definitions, terms, and  analogies ( Graf & Maas, 2008 ). Specifically, there are two main streams of theoretical differentiable  approaches for CLV, identified as   CLV from a company perspective and CLV from a customer’s  perspective. However, both approaches have limitations on spatial capability that been used   for  estimating the profitability of business.  Traditionally, CLV model is mostly developed based on financial, accounting or consumer  purchasing based instruments.   In the firm - based CLV model, CLV is developed based on accounting  or financial based measu rement with high consideration on items such as costs, expenses, investment,  rate, and any kind of tangible values that was cited in major works of Rust , et al.   (2004); Gupta and  Zeithaml (2006);   Gupta ,   et al.   (2006);   and Bejou ,   et al.   (2007).   In contrast to the perspective of  customer - based CLV model, CLV is more on customer - related behavior purchasing activity, such as  recency, frequency, and monetary instruments, as described as RFM model by Libey (1998). Similarly,  both perspectives are mod elled either based on mathematical or statistical modelling with finale aim  to estimate the profitability customers to the business. However, all of CLV models are not applicable  to visualize the CLV results in term of spatial location, as customer located   in the geographical  marketplace.  Modelling the CLV of customer should be aligned with modelling the customers and  marketplace where the traditional CLV model is not in capability.   Technically, most of the CLV  traditional model have had emphasized on cost ing for estimating the sustaining of profitability of the  business, for example the Gamma/Gamma sub model by Fader ,   et al. (2005); and Customer Pathing  model by Lenskold (2003). However, these models are not aligned with the current changes in  marketplace   as latest information are not be able to integrated into the CLV model. As evident, the  increasing price on customer product and its implications to frequency and monetary value of  purchasing on the side of customer is out - off prediction of any CLV model   a s reported by Hillier and  Karki ( 2008). Consequently, the traditional CLV model has less advantage to be applied depending on  the change of marketplaces.  The traditional CLV model as well as financial/account types models, CRM/marketing type’s  models,   ope ration/decision   science   types   models   and   ICT/Computer   science   based   models  consistently apply financial or accounting related instruments. For example,   Customer Segment  Knowledge Model by Ha and Bae   (2006)   has utilized financial based instruments, but   does not  support any analysis related to location of customer. In fact, non - financial instrument such as  accessibility and location can affect the profitability of business as mentioned in some work of  Carpenter and Moore (2006); Bromley and Matthews (2007 ); and Andronikov (2008). This is also  supported by Wang ,   et al.   (2008) as they noted that   predicting the CLV of a customer requires several  related factors to location. The predicted problem is transformed to a problem of creating a mapping  function havin g all related features as its variables. Thus, according to these scholars ,   new technique  must be introduced for modelling the CLV by integrating the non - financial variables into it.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   |   DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849388  9  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  Methodically, a combination of GIS - survey methods i s used in this study where it involves  two types of data, that is, spatial and non - spatial data. Non - spatial data are processed and converted  into spatial and attributes data first before they are combined with spatial data. In fact, spatialization  process   is applied to non - spatial data to transform it to a suitable format which is spatial format.  Meanwhile, some procedures are applied and or developed by the researcher to integrate the spatial  and non - spatial data into a platform of GIS.  2 .1   Non - Spatial   Variables  For this study, RFM model will apply to non - database customer, which is done by calculating  on individual value, as applied by related studies of RFM model. In formula, RFM is represented in  equation as below:  CLV = R x F x M  Where,  R = the   latest purchase amount.  F = the total number of purchases during a specific period.  M = monetary value spent during one specific period.  Technically, Kumar and Reintz (2006) mentioned that one of the methods used for computing  the RFM value is involves the   computation of relative weights for each R, F, and M. For this study,  this option was applied where the RFM database of free customer was established first, as sources  from the survey data. The establishment of free customer database has a similar functio n to the CRM  traditional database.  2.2   Spatial and Tabular Data  Basically, the development of GIS conceptual model of SCLV will comprise spatial and non -  spatial data. Basically, the common spatial data are boundary, road and street, mukim, residential  area, and so on. It is important to develop the physical side of geographical marketplace of the study.  Meanwhile, specific spatial data were developed by the researcher. They are related to items or  variables that were used in the questionnaires. Spatial   data that were used for developing the  geographical marketplace of Seberang Perai Tengah (SPT).   With regard to geographical marketplace  of SPT, a spatial data related to section of demographic background and hypermarket selection and  CLV were also needed.  The softwares chosen for the study were ArcView, ArcGIS, Google Earch Pro/Google Add,  Statch Map, iTouchMap (online coordinate software), SPSS and Excell. The main software used was  ArcView which was suitable for the purposes of the study to develop a mod el, design layers and  database. GIS software was used for mapping and developing spatial model, as well as for modelling  the   spatial   data   and   performing   the   spatialization   process   from   non - spatial   to   spatial   data.  Meanwhile, SPSS and Excell were used for p rocessing the data from the survey as well as for  developing the database of free customer, performing statistical analysis and testing the variables.  In order to modelling the CLV spatial data, vector model was utilized to model the data. As  discussed be fore in chapter 2, vector data models the information about points, lines, and polygons as  x, y coordinate. As example of modelling, the postal address needs to be in points based data. In this  study,   some procedures   were developed   and   applied to perform t hese duties,   which   will   be  explained, accordingly in the chapter. In addition, for the non - spatial data, the conversion process is\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   |   DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849388  10  vital where raw data from survey will be converted to the tabular form. The transformation of non -  spatial into spatial data i s for make the data available to integrate with spatial data.  2.3   Spatial Database Development  In order to develop a database of SCLV, various datasets representing spatial and non - spatial  activities of the study need to be integrated based on database   method. Basically, digital basic data, as  described before, were upgraded on its attributes according to the requirement of the study. This is  because it is possible that current spatial data is out - of - date and less concurrent, as well as less  complete, ac cording to the current status of the data as in the real situation.  The non - spatial data, survey was developed based on section of the questionnaires. These  tabular data were used with spatial data, where it was possible to integrate via some procedures, a s  such geo reference, geo coding, and spatial joint procedures. With regard to spatial and non - spatial  data, the whole process of conversion and integration of spatial and non - spatial data is applied in the  project.  2.4   Location of the Study  Seberang Perai especially Seberang Perai Tengah (SPT) was chosen as a location of the study  with some reasons as mentioned in literature review. Basically, Seberang Perai is part of the Penang  state situated   in   a narrow   hinterland   opposite   Penang   Island   in   the Northern   part   of   Malay  Peninsula r . Seberang Perai lies wholly between 5˚ 5’ 00’’ N and 5˚ 35’ 00’’ N latitude and it covers  from East to West longitude of 100˚ 20’ 00’’ E and 100˚ 35’ 00’’ E. The other towns in the Seberang  Perai area include Butterworth,   Bukit Mertajam ,   Seberang Jaya ,   Sungai Puyu ,   Prai ,   Nibong Tebal ,  Juru, and   Kepala Batas . In addition, SPT is surrounded by urbanization, with modern infrastructures  and info - structure. It is the major centre for the modernization of the whole of Seberang Perai.  Basically, the Seberang Perai Tengah of   Pulau Pinang in Malaysia is chosen as a location of  study for some reasons. Firstly, Seberang Perai Tengah is a centre of development of Seberang Perai  where it places main sector of business, government, private, and infrastructure. This is similar to  Na rimah   (2002) whereby Seberang Perai   area,   including Seberang Perai Tengah has currently  developed rapidly since 1970s. One of the reasons is that urban development in Seberang Perai was  mainly due to industrialization and spill - over demand from Penang Isla nd. It is located in the  strategic location of the Northern Region of Peninsular Malaysia. Therefore, with regard to Narimah,  SPT is a heart of the Northern Region of Peninsular Malaysia that might potentially represent the  latest trend and future prospect   of the North area.  The second reason for the selection of the area is the availability of hypermarkets and other  related retailing business, in a huge number compared to the total population of Seberang Perai itself.  Meaning that this area will be more in teresting for testing the latest version lifetime model that can  estimate how long the business can survive. The third reason is Seberang Perai contains various  ethnic and religion, where is has potentially to represent Malaysian study of CLV. Because of e ach  ethnic group has different fresh food consumption and usage, even differs in many aspects, this area  is challenging for the study where analysis by individual RFM will be hard   to compare to normal  customer.  3. FINDINGS  3 .1   Geographical Marketplace of   Seberang Perai Tengah  The physical aspect of the study area requires compressing the spatial data which consist of  the boundary of SPT, basically, includes the Mukim and residential areas, recreation parks, as well as  residential areas within the SP population, which are availa ble in polygon - based data. The spatial\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   |   DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849388  11  data of street and road systems including the highways are also important to represent the location of  free customers which are available in line - based data. In addition, the spatial data of major towns in  SP, as well   as Seberang Jaya, Butterworth, Sungai Dua, Kepala Batas, Bukit Mertajam, Juru, Jawi,  Permatang Pauh, and Perai are visualized in point - based data. Locations of major towns can be used  in analyzing the free customers’ locations, instead of the location of   the hypermarkets and alternative  stores. Figure 1 is a map of the physical boundary of SPT.  Figure 1.   Geographical Marketplace of SPT  In general,   SPT is a prolific area for business. There exist many types of business as well as  markets, retailers,   whole salers, business complexes, petrol stations, and many more. It was found  from the literature survey of hypermarket business that SPT is an important place for conducting  business, since customers from SPT, as well as SPU and SPS can come to do transa ctions with the  hypermarket or any retailing business. The SPT as a centre of business activity, with all kinds of  retailing   business   faced   huge competitions especially to   stimulate the recency,   frequency and  spending amount to their preferred business sto re.  Figure 2 shows all Hypermarkets and alternative markets in SPT which were included in the  spatial data of hypermarket and alternative markets of the geographical marketplace of SPT.   T he  retailing business in SPT is currently facing high competi tion   bec ause it contains a huge number of  hypermarkets, supermarkets, minimarkets and alternative stores. At the same time, a high number of  traditional markets are operating in the area, as well as public markets, night markets, agro markets,  and many more.   Over all , the spatial data related to the development of geographical marketplace,  include each component of the SCLV model.  3.2   Spatialization of the Postal Address Location  In this project, postal addresses of respondents were acquired to trace their location   in the  geographical marketplace. Postal addresses of the respondents represented the location of free  customers, as they appear in the real marketplace.   Basically, the postal address must contain 5 details:  number of house; street and or road; residential park or village; postal code; and town/district. In the  dBase1V format, these data were placed into 7 fields, and designed with an IdName; Address (no of\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   |   DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849388  12  house and street and or road); Alias (alternative of address); Postcode; Residential Park/Village;  Town; and Districts, as shows in Figure 3   and Table 1 .  Figure 2.   A Visualization of the Geographical Marketplace of SPT .  Figure 3.   Spatial Postal Address of Customer in SPT.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   |   DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849388  13  Table 1 .   Postal Address with Longitude and Latitude.  3 .3 Integration of FRM to   Location  As RFM does not available in spatial   format, it is important to understand how RFM can be  transformed into spatial form.   In fact, the postal address of the individual free customer was used as a  point for placing the RFM value. For that, the RFM data were represented as tabular data in  DBASE1V format and were placed into spatial postal address, as well as tied to the most pr eferred  choice of hypermarket. Therefore, the spatial join data was used to integrate and spatialize these data.  Before RFM data were jointed with attributes of spatial postal address, the RFM data were  converted into Dbase1V format, as shown   in Table 2   be low. The database contained some columns, as  such R, F, M, RFM and RFM Weight. In fact, because RFM is available in a five months’ series, in total  the five months’ data of RFM had been transformed into database format.   T he data of RFM were  modeled by using colored pin points as well as matching them with the spatial postal address of the  respondents. The values of RFM differed from each other and they could be identified by location  based on the streets and roads.  Table   2 .   Example of RFM Database  4. DISCUSSION  Basically, each component data of CLV (RFM) would be presented in individual point, based  on location of postal address of the free customer. Basically, it was possible to produce four types of  maps identified   as the Map of Recency and Frequency of Individual Customer (See Figure 4   and  Figure 5 ) and   the Map of Spending and Combination of RFM of Individual Customer   (See Figure 6\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   |   DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849388  14  and Figure 7 ) .   These specific maps were beneficial in   analysing   each component of RFM   in relation  the spatial attributes and geographical marketplace.  In Figure 4, the recency of purchasing the fresh food is indicated by eight scales, starting from  1 day until 8 days, where each category has its own score. Its shows that minimum score was days  with 3 respondents, while the maximum score was 3 days with 1 18 respondents, meaning that a  majority of free customers revisited the hypermarket within 3 days, as the range of the current and  previous   purchases   of fresh food was 3 days.  In addition, for the frequency of purchasing fresh food, as shown in Figure 5   it   was arranged  in nine scales, starting from 2 times per month, followed by 3 times per month, 4 times per month  until 10 times per month, each had a unique score. In fact, the minority score was dedicated to the  category of 9 times per month with 9 respond ents, while the majority score went to the category of 6  times per month with 99 respondents. The spatial recency and frequency will be discussed in   the  spatial analysis part late  Figure 4 .   Recency   Figure 5 .   Frequency  For the variable of   monetary   value of RFM as shown in   Figure 6, the spending value of each  customer was visualized in sixteen major classes, starting   from the lowest value of RM250 per month,  followed by RM300 per month until the highest value up to RM950 per month. In fact, f or the  minimum value, the minimum score was RM 860 with 1 respondent, while the maximum score was  RM 550 with 84 respondents. The   most of the spending value was RM450, while the average  spending, as according to 400 respondents was RM460.00.  By combining R, F, and M variables into a matrix value, the RFM   matrix   value would pointed  on the individual location, as shown in Figure 7.   I n total, there were, 35 matrix values, and the  minority score was dedicated to values such as 124, 142, 213, and so on with a total of 8 matrixs,  scored by 1 respondent each. The majority score was dedicated to matrix 333 and 332 with 52  respondents and re s pectively.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   |   DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849388  15  Figure 6 .   Moneta ry   Figure 7 .   Combination of RFM  RFM can be recategorized, into four major categories . In Figure 8 and Figure 9 , the score   of  RFM Matrix and RFM Weight values were re - categorized into four major classes. For the RFM Matrix  value,   as shown in Figure 8 , the   minimum values want to the lower category (122   –   242); middle  lower (243 - 324); middle upper (325   –   344) and top value (345   –   444). From a different point of view, it  was possible to visualize the RFM is possible to visualize based on weight value, as calculated by  RFM weight formula .   The use of weight value was better than RFM score value as before, where it  could show RFM in   absolute value as well   as individual unit.  Figure 8 .   The Score of RFM Matrix   Figure 9 .   RFM Weight values  Figure 9   shows RFM   based on weight value, where the classes   were arranged into categories  of 13 - 21 (lower value), 22 - 26   (middle lower) , 27 - 31 ( middle upper)   and 32 - 40   top value . With reference\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   |   DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849388  16  to this result and literature review, the bottom category of customer needed more attention from the  hypermarket whereby so me promotional activities should be done to increase the value. Meanwhile,  for the top value, the hypermarket needed to retain the RFM activity among the customers, as well as  sustain their relationship.  5. CONCLUSION  In conclusion, modelling the spatial   RFM as CLV is important. This was done by integrating  the spatial and non - spatial data which was required to obtain the lifetime value of free customers. It is  important for sustaining the business performance of both current and future prospects of the  b usiness. Besides that, a basic spatial RFM is workable to be applied to other variables such as  demographic background. In fact, spatial RFM should be tested with shopping behavior data, as a  requirement of the RFM model in a natural setting. Meanwhile, th e potential developments of RFM  model become critical by using open sources technology such as Apps software, open database,  android platform and so on.

Addressing the challenges of diminishing natural  sand resources and increasing construction waste. The objective here is to evaluate the feasibility of using alternative  materials with particle sizes of 4.75mm to 0.15mm,   which are commonly found in concrete mixtures, to maintain or  improve the structural integrity of paving blocks while promoting sustainable construction practices. Concrete  mixtures with a ratio of 1:2:4 were tested with sand replacements of 0%, 5% (2.5%   shell powder and 2.5%  construction waste powder) and 10% (5.0% shell powder and 5.0% construction waste powder). The results of the  slump test showed a decrease in workability with increasing percentage of replacement with the result values   being  14.01mm , 10.00mm and 7.99mm respectively. Despite this reduction, all mixtures remained within the acceptable  actual slump range. To ensure sufficient workability for pavement applications. In particular, the compressive  strength test showed that the 5% replaceme nt mixture achieved the highest compressive strength of 45.41 MPa at  28 days, which outperformed the control mixture. This shows that using this alternative material can improve the  quality of concrete while conserving natural resources and managing waste   effectively. This innovation reduces  environmental impact, which promotes the use of high - quality waste and is in line with the goal of sustainable  construction. This solution shows potential for commercialization for the construction industry, especially   in  producing non - structural paving blocks. Recognizing this innovation, the study has advanced to the final stage of  the \\\"Joint Proposal Defense Session of the TRANS - TECH 4TVET Grant Technical Committee 2025\\\" and won third  place at the INNOTEX DCE Polytech nic Kota Bharu Exhibition 2024.

INTRODUCTION  The introduction highlights the growing demand for su stainable innovation in the construction  industry. Excessive sand mining has caused significant environmental degradation, such as soil erosion  and habitat loss (Koehnken, 2020). The use of semi - crushed shells   and semi   construction waste as a  partial repla cement for sand with a size between 4.75mm and 0.15mm in paving blocks provides an  environmentally friendly solution to this challenge. This study also focuses on evaluating the feasibility  of a structure and environment in which this approach is implement ed while aligning with global  sustainable construction goals (Mohammed, 2023). In addition, various mechanical tests such as drop  and compression tests were conducted in this study. This research offers empirical evidence of the  potential of this waste mat erial to effectively replace sand while maintaining or even improving the  structural properties of paving   blocks. Therefore, this   article discusses innovations in using semi -  crushed shells and construction concrete waste as replacement materials in the con struction industry,\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849407  19  where it focuses on reducing environmental impact and also improving resource efficiency in the  production of paving blocks.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  Material Preparation   t his study actually used seashells obtained from seafood industry wa ste  and concrete waste from building demolition sites. While both materials were cleaned and crushed  using a crushing machine to obtain the appropriate particle size (Koehnken, 2020). The particle size for  seashells and concrete waste was in the range of 0 .15 mm to 4.75 mm, which is the standard size of sand  for concrete mixtures (Rahman, 2021). Seashells were collected from seafood processing areas, while  concrete waste was obtained from local construction sites (Mohammed, 2023).The mixture design  involved   three sand replacement ratios namely: 0% (control mixture), 5%, and 10% replacement using  a combination of semi - crushed seashells and semi - crushed concrete waste. The mixture was produced  with a ratio of 1:2:4 (cement: sand: coarse aggregate). Which is th e standard ratio in the production of  paving blocks (Chen, 2023). Each mixture was tested to evaluate mechanical performance which  includes compressive strength and workability (Tam, 2023). The replacement ratio of 5% and 10% was  chosen based on previous s tudies that showed that replacing part of the sand with waste materials can  improve the properties of concrete (López - Uceda, 2022).Test Procedure   have two test such as:   (i)  Compression Test:   Compression tests were performed using a compression machine to   measure the  compressive strength of the paving blocks after a hardening period of 28 days (Zhang, 2022). This test  was conducted according to ASTM C39 standards to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data (Bao  & Lu, 2023).   ( ii) Slump Test:   The worka bility of the concrete mixture was tested using a slump test. The  slump value reflects the ability of the concrete mix to flow without losing integrity (Rahman, 2021).   The  results of this test will be analysed to identify the most suitable mix in terms of   mechanical performance  and environmental sustainability.  3. FINDINGS  The results of this study show that the use of crushed shell and construction waste as a partial  substitute for sand in the production of paving blocks is viable. The main results obtain ed from the  tests carried out are as follows:  Figure 1 .

The recorded slump  values were as follows: 14.01 mm   fall rate   for the mix with 0 % replacement ,   while   10.00 mm   fall rate  for 5% replacement   and 7. 99 mm for 10% replacement. Despite the reduction in slump values, all mixes  remained within the \\\"true slump\\\" range, indicating acceptable workability for pavement concrete  applications. This highlights the viability of using alternative materials such as   crushed shell and  construction waste without affecting the workability of the mixture .  3 .2   Compression Test  Figure 4   (a) .

At 28 days, the compressive strength improved to 38.99 MPa fo r the control mix,  45.41 MPa for the 5% replacement, and 37.79 MPa for the 10% replacement.   The 5% replacement mix  showed the highest compressive strength increase (2 5 .36%), indicating optimal performance at this  level of substitution .  4. DISCUSSION  Figure 4 .

Among the eco - friendly concrete products are those that combine seashells and waste materials such as  recycled concrete waste.  The findings suggest that replacing up to 10% of sand with crushed shell and construction  waste does not compromise the compressive strength of the paving blocks. The 5% replacement mix  not only meets but exceeds the minimum industry standard for compressi ve strength, making it the  most promising for practical applications.   \\\"The use of recycled materials such as recycled concrete  construction waste and partially crushed shells not only reduces dependence on natural resources but  also significantly contribut es to more sustainable and environmentally friendly construction practices  (Ahn et al., 2020; Bhattacharjee et al., 2021; Khalaf et al., 2020).\\\"   These results validate the potential of  using crushed shell and concrete waste to produce environmentally sustainable paving blocks with  structural integrity comparable to conventional ones. The study highlights the dual benefits of this  innovation, inclu ding effective waste management and conservation of natural sand resources.  .  5. CONCLUSION  The study titled “Sustainable Innovation in Pavement Block Production: Using Half - Concrete  Shells   and   Half - Concrete   Waste”   underscores the feasibility   of   employin g   crushed   shells   and  construction waste as partial substitutes for sand in paving block production. The results indicate that  this alternative material can produce paving blocks with compressive strength that matches or even  surpasses that of conventional   blocks, making it particularly suitable for non - structural applications.  The research identifies an optimal mix with a 5% sand replacement, achieving an excellent balance  between mechanical properties and workability, while meeting established industry sta ndards for  paving block applications.   This approach offers promising potential for   advancing sustainable  construction practices. Nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to evaluate the long - term  durability and scalability of this method, particula rly under diverse environmental condit ions and  extended usage periods,   Bao and Lu (2023) .

INTRODUCTION  The pursuit of effective teaching methods remains a cornerstone of educational excellence and  a key driver of student success. In professional education programs, where student populations are  increasingly diverse in terms of backgrounds, lea rning styles, and experiences, teaching effectiveness  demands a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Despite growing recognition of the need for  inclusivity in pedagogy, many teaching evaluation systems remain anchored in traditional metrics,  often failin g to capture the complexity and dynamism of diverse classroom environments. Inclusive  pedagogical practices offer a critical strategy for addressing these challenges by fostering equitable and  accessible learning spaces tailored to the diverse needs of all   learners (Darling - Hammond et al., 2017).  Pedagogy, as the art and science of teaching, plays a pivotal role in building meaningful  connections between educators and learners. The significance of adopting innovative pedagogical  techniques has become increa singly evident, particularly as educators strive to create engaging,  dynamic, and holistic educational experiences. Professional development is central to this endeavor,\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volu me 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849434  26  equipping educators with the skills, knowledge, and mindset needed to implement inclus ive teaching  practices effectively. These practices not only promote student engagement and critical thinking but  also enhance academic achievement (Bascopé et al., 2019).  Recent scholarship underscores the transformative potential of high - quality professi onal  development in fostering changes in teaching practices and improving student learning outcomes.  Educational reforms across disciplines have emphasized the need for sustained, targeted initiatives that  empower   educators to master   sophisticated pedagogi cal competencies,   including   deep content  knowledge, critical thinking, and effective collaboration (Darling - Hammond et al., 2017; Borko et al.,  2010).  Assessing teaching effectiveness in higher education, however, is an inherently complex task.  Berk (2016)   identifies fifteen potential measures of teaching effectiveness, ranging from student ratings  and peer   reviews   to teaching portfolios and   the   analysis   of learning   outcomes.   Employing   a  combination of these measures, rather than relying on a singular appro ach, offers a more nuanced and  comprehensive understanding of teaching quality and professional growth.  This study builds upon these insights to propose, develop, and validate responsive evaluation  tools   tailored   to   professional   education   settings.   By   expl oring   diverse   measures   of   teaching  effectiveness and anchoring them within established pedagogical frameworks, this research seeks to  enhance instructional quality and foster professional development, ultimately contributing to more  inclusive and effective   teaching practices.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  This study employs a quantitative research design . The aim is to   design   responsive evaluation  tools   specifically for the professional program .  The study draws on a range of established theories and frameworks rel evant to inclusive  pedagogy, including Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP),  Transformative Learning Theory, Constructivist Learning Theory, Adult Learning Theory, and Bloom’s  Taxonomy. However, a comprehensive review o f the literature has identified UDL and CRP as the most  relevant to this study, serving as its theoretical foundation. UDL emphasizes the design of teaching  practices   that   accommodate   diverse   learners   by   providing   multiple   means   of   engagement,  representati on, and action, thereby promoting flexibility and accessibility in learning environments.  Initially developed for special education, UDL has since been widely applied across educational  contexts to support diverse learner needs (Rose, 2000; Roski, Walkowia k, & Nehring, 2021). In  professional education, UDL’s adaptable framework is particularly valuable, fostering instructional  strategies that enhance engagement and learning outcomes for a broad spectrum of students.  Similarly, CRP underscores the importance   of incorporating students’ cultural backgrounds  into teaching practices, emphasizing cultural competence, high expectations, and student - centered  approaches (Montenegro & Jankowski, 2017). By valuing and reflecting the cultural identities of  learners, CRP   fosters equitable and inclusive learning environments, ensuring students from diverse  backgrounds feel respected and engaged. Research demonstrates that culturally responsive teaching  significantly enhances inclusivity, addressing disparities in education al engagement and performance,  particularly   in   diverse professional   settings.   Together,   UDL   and   CRP provide complementary  frameworks that address the structural, practical, and cultural dimensions of inclusive teaching,  making them integral to this study’s   exploration of responsive evaluation tools.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volu me 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849434  27  3. FINDINGS  The findings offer valuable insights into enhancing the alignment between current teaching  evaluation practices and the diverse needs of learners in professional programs. Traditional evaluation  met hods, which often rely heavily on standardized metrics, may not fully capture the effectiveness of  educators in implementing inclusive and culturally responsive practices. This points to a promising  opportunity for developing evaluation tools rooted in UDL   and CRP, which prioritize adaptability,  inclusiveness, and cultural sensitivity in teaching.   The proposed responsive evaluation tools, illustrated  in Figure 1, are grounded in the three core principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and the  four f oundational principles of Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP).  Figure 1 . Th e proposed evaluation tools .  The expected outcomes are t hree distinct surveys   focusing on students, self - reflection, and peer  review. Peer review could be a person from the sam e program or a different program which may  provide real feedback to avoid bias alike.

DISCUSSION  T eaching effectiveness in higher education   is   a never - ending quest.   Understanding the issues,  challenges, and ways to improve teaching and learning will enable the delivery of a higher - quality  education as deemed by various stakeholders.  T eaching effective ness   assessment   highlighted the challenges educators face   in meeting the  varied needs of students   with   differing   learning abilities, cultural backgrounds, and experiences.   These  findings resonate with existing research that indicates effective implementati on of inclusive teaching  practices can lead to meaningful improvements in student engagement, satisfaction, and   learning\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volu me 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849434  28  outcomes ( Tadesse, Ware, Asmare, & Gillies, 2024 ).   Focusing on enhancing participation, a stronger  sense of belonging within the classr oom could be fostered. This may ultimately contribute to the  academic success of all students, particularly those with diverse learning needs.  The highlighted key points emphasize the integration of students\\\'   voices   and engagement with  professional develop ment through effective evaluation methods. Listening to students is essential in  understanding their learning experiences and challenges. By encouraging students to share their  perspectives, educators can gain valuable insights into how well their teaching   practices align with  student needs ( Conner,   202 2 ). Gathering feedback via   entry and exit   surveys or informal discussions  helps educators assess engagement levels and identify areas for improvement ( Falchikov, 2013 ).  Fostering collaboration is another critical element that promotes   student - centered   learning.  Encouraging students to participate in   group   activities or discussions allows them   to interact  meaningfully, improving their engagement and fostering a more inclus ive environment ( Oleson, 2023 ).  In connection with professional development, evaluations serve as a tool for identifying teachers\\\'  needs. Personalized evaluations help pinpoint areas requiring attention, guiding educators   toward  specific learning opportuni ties such as workshops and courses (Darling - Hammond et al., 2017).  Engaging in these development activities equips educators with new strategies to enhance their  teaching methods, ultimately benefiting both their professional growth and their students\\\' suc cess.  5.0 CONCLUSION  This   study emphasizes the vital role of responsive evaluation tools in fostering a culture of  continuous   improvement   within   higher   education.   By   focusing   on   enhancing   pedagogical  effectiveness, it empowers educators to continuously re fine their teaching practices and provides them  with the tools necessary to meet the diverse needs of their students. Through the integration of   the  Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP )   principles, the  proposed evalu ation framework strives to support educators in delivering the highest quality of  education.  As educators are equipped with personalized feedback, targeted training, and opportunities  for collaborative reflection, they are better positioned to drive impro vements that benefit student  engagement, participation, and overall learning outcomes. Ultimately, fostering a dynamic, inclusive  teaching environment is key to ensuring that all students thrive academically and personally, thereby  contributing to the long - term success of professional education programs.  A dopting evaluation tools that   encompass   UDL and CRP principles can drive   meaningful  enhancements   in teaching practices and student outcomes.   These   tools not only provide educators with  valuable   feedback fo r   their   professional growth but also foster a more equitable and supportive  educational environment for all learners.   Before implementation, t he proposed evaluation tools will  undergo some testing   phase .   Future research should focus on the longitudinal imp act of these tools and  strategies,   investigating   their potential to reshape   and transform   the broader landscape of professional  education.

INTRODUCTION  Innovative approaches, like thermoelectric modules, offer a promising way to develop water  bottles that can heat and cool liquids effectively. Integrating   digital hydration tracking systems and  real - time temperature displays can help promote healthy hydration habits, especially for people who  lead active lifestyles. This approach provides a sustainable solution that improves daily life. This study  is about c reating a smart water bottle that combines various features into a convenient and easy - to - use  product .  1.1   Problem Statement  Staying properly hydrated is very important for our health and well - being. However, many  people find it difficult to drink enough water   because they have busy schedules, forget to drink, or do  not have easy access to drinks that are at the right temperature. Current water bottles do not have  multiple functions that can meet various needs, such as heating for hot beverages, cooling for ref reshing  drinks, and monitoring water consumption. The difference is especially noticeable in places where\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | D OI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849812  31  people lead active lifestyles and in areas with changing weather, as it can be hard to find hot or cold  water when needed. Furthermore, many products   available today are not environmentally friendly, as  they lead to waste due to single - use plastics and designs that are not energy - efficient. To tackle these  challenges, we need a new product that combines thermoelectric temperature control, hydration  remi nders, and real - time temperature monitoring. It should also be eco - friendly, portable, and  designed with the user in mind. This would improve personal hydration practices and also support the  ideas of sustainability and the United Nations Sustainable Devel opment Goals (SDGs ) .  1.2   Objectives  This research aims to develop a smart water bottle capable of:  1.   Heating and cooling water using a compact thermoelectric module.  2.   Displaying real - time water temperature.  3.   Providing hydration reminders through a buil t - in notification system.  4.   Supporting sustainability by utilizing eco - friendly materials and USB - rechargeable lithium - ion  batteries.  1.3   SDG Relevance  The project supports SDG 3 (Good Health and Well - being) by promoting hydration awareness  and its   eco - conscious design aligns with SDG 12 (Responsi ble Consumption and Production) .  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  2.1   System Overview  The Portable Water Bottle Heating and Cooling System is designed to maintain the temperature  of liquids using thermoelectric technology.   This system combines Thermoelectric Coolers (TECs),  Thermoelectric Generators (TEGs), a temperature sensor, an Arduino microcontroller, and a lithium -  ion battery to efficiently heat or cool the water inside the bottle. The following sections describe the  detailed components and materials used in cons tructing this innovative bottle .  2.2   Thermoelectric Modules (TEM)  The system utilizes TECs and TEGs to create a temperature difference through the Peltier effect.  TECs facilitate the heating and cooling processes b y causing one side of the module to cool while the  opposite side heats up when electric current flows through the junction of two different conductors.  TEGs, in turn, help in energy harvesting to maintain the energy efficiency of the system. This i s based  on the Peltier effect ( The Peltier effect is the reverse phenomenon of the Seebeck effect; the electrical  current flowing through the junction connecting two materials will emit or absorb heat per unit time at  the junction to balance the difference in the   chemical potential of the two materials), where an electric  current passing through a junction of two different conductors creates a cooling effect on one side and  heating on the other .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | D OI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849812  32  2.3   Temperature Sensing  The DS18B20 is a flexible digital thermometer th at uses 1 - Wire technology and allows for  programmable resolution. It is suitable for use in a heating and cooling water bottle to give accurate  temperature readings in real - time. The device provides a broad temperature range from   - 55°C to  +125°C, with an a ccuracy of ±0.5°C between   - 10°C and +85°C. This ensures accurate monitoring of the  temperature of the liquid. The DS18B20 uses a 1 - Wire bus for communication, which makes the design  easier because it   only needs one data   line and   a ground connection   to comm unicate with   a  microprocessor. This sensor is designed to measure temperature and can be set to different resolutions  between 9 and 12 bits. The standard setting is 12 bits, which allows for a small change in temperature  of 0.0625°C.  The capability to fu nction in parasite power mode, which allows it to draw power from the  data line, is especially advantageous for compact designs such as water bottles. This feature minimises  the requirement for extra wiring. The DS18B20 also has programmable alarm function s that allow users  to set upper and lower temperature limits. This feature helps in providing safety alerts for temperatures  that are too high or too low. Every DS18B20 sensor comes with a distinct 64 - bit serial code. This feature  enables several sensors t o operate on the same 1 - Wire bus, which is beneficial for more complicated  applications or potential product enhancements. The features of the DS18B20 make it a very good  option for measuring temperature in your heating and cooling water bottle project .  2.4   Control Unit  An Arduino microcontroller is central to the system\\\'s operation, processing the temperature  data from the DS18B20 sensor. The Arduino compares the real - time temperature with a predefined set  point and sends signals to the TECs to either heat o r cool the water. This automated control ensures  consistent temperature regulation .  2.5   Power Supply  The thermoelectric smart bottle leverages the advantages of lithium - ion battery technology to  ensure efficient and reliable operation. One of the key benefits   of lithium - ion batteries is their  customizable operating voltage, which can be tailored through insertion reactions to meet the specific  power requirements of the thermoelectric module and digital components. This flexibility allows the  smart bottle to ach ieve optimal performance for both heating and cooling functions while maintaining  energy efficiency. The inclusion of lithium - ion batteries also enhances portability and usability, as these  batteries are known for their high energy density, excellent charg e – discharge cycle performance, and  reliable operation under varied conditions. With extended operational life, lithium - ion batteries are  widely used in a wide range of industries, such as electrified marine transportation systems, stationary  energy storage   systems, electric propulsion in space, and electric mobility (Wang, 2025). By integrating  lithium - ion technology, the product ensures a sustainable, high - performance power source that  supports its innovative features and aligns with eco - friendly practices .  2.6   User Interface  The system incorporates an LED indicator to provide visual feedback on the operational status,  indicating whether the bottle is in heating or cooling mode. This feature enhances user interaction by  providing real - time system updates.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | D OI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849812  33  2.7   Heat Dissipation  To ensure the thermoelectric modules operate efficiently and prevent overheating, the system  includes heat sinks made of aluminum or copper. These materials are chosen for their excellent thermal  conductivity, which aids in the effective d issipation of heat from the TECs  2.8   Material Composition  The materials selected for constructing the bottle are crucial for its functionality, durability, and  safety:  ●   Outer Shell: 304 stainless steel is used for its durability, corrosion resistance, and th ermal  retention properties. It also ensures that the water’s taste remains unaffected.  ●   Silicone Coating: For easier handling and gripping of the water bottle.  ●   Insulation Layer: Polyurethane foam insulation is used to reduce heat transfer, while some  models may incorporate vacuum insulation to enhance thermal retention.  ●   Thermoelectric Module Housing: Lightweight metals like aluminum or durable plastics  provide structural integrity and facilitate heat dissipation.  ●   Seals and Gaskets: Food - grade sil icone or rubber ensures airtight seals to maintain the bottle\\\'s  insulation and prevent leaks.  ●   Electronics Housing: Durable plastic or metal enclosures protect the electronic components  from environmental factors.  ●   Active Buzzer: Connects through ardui no to remind users about water consumption.  ●   Lithium - ion Batteries: Rechargeable batteries for long lasting usage.  ●   3D1C Integrated Circuit: Control heating and cooling by managing the thermoelectric  elements to heat and cool the water, as well as effi ciently regulating power delivery from  lithium - ion batteries.  2.9   Cooling and Heating Duration  The time required to cool or heat the water depends on several factors, including the power of  the thermoelectric modules, initial water temperature, ambient tempera ture, and volume of water.  Generally,   higher   power   TECs   and   efficient   heat   dissipation   mechanisms   can   achieve   faster  temperature changes .  2.10   Food - Grade Materials  All materials in contact with the liquid are food - grade to ensure user safety.  ●   Stainless Stee l (304 or 316): Used for its non - reactive properties and ease of cleaning.  ●   BPA - Free Plastics: Used for components like the lid or outer casing, ensuring no harmful  chemicals leach into the water (Brent, 2023).  ●   Food - Grade Silicone: Utilized for seals   and gaskets to prevent leaks and maintain hygiene.  This combination of advanced thermoelectric technology, durable materials, and user - friendly  design makes the Portable Water Bottle Heating and Cooling System an effective solution for  maintaining the   desired temperature of beverages on the go.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | D OI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849812  34  2.11   Time Estimation for Heating and Cooling Water Using a TEC1 - 12706 Peltier Module (Theory)  a.

Recommendations  i.   Ideal Water Volume  ●   For faster heating and cooling, consider reducing the water volume to 250 - 300 mL. This will  significantly redu ce the required energy and time, effectively halving them.  ii.   Efficiency Enhancements  ●   Insulation: Use better insulation around the water container to minimize heat exchange with  the surroundings, thus improving the efficiency.  ●   Heat Sinks and Fans:   Install efficient heat sinks and fans to enhance the dissipation of heat from  the Peltier module.  iii.   Practical Expectations  ●   In real - world conditions, the actual times might be slightly longer due to inefficiencies in heat  transfer and power supply.  g.   Performance Factors Influencing Heating and Cooling Time  The heating and cooling time is influenced by several factors:  ●   Power of Thermoelectric Modules: The higher the power, the faster the process.  ●   Initial Water Temperature: Starting temperature   of the water significantly affects the time  needed.  ●   Water Volume: Larger volumes require more energy and time.  ●   Ambient Temperature: Higher ambient temperatures can slow down cooling processes.  ●   Heat Dissipation Efficiency: Efficient heat dissipation mechanisms reduce the time required.  ●   User - defined Settings: Custom settings, such as desired final temperature, affect the time  needed.  h.   Estimated Time Range  Based on these factors, the heating   and cooling time can range from a few minutes to over an  hour, depending on the specific setup and conditions.  3. FINDINGS  The level of hydration and the way fluids are consumed can greatly affect how well adolescents  think and perform mentally. A study   carried out in Petaling Perdana, Malaysia, found that more than  half of the adolescent participants were either mildly or moderately dehydrated, with a percentage of  59.6%. In contrast, only 33% of the participants were considered well - hydrated. The cognit ive  performance of well - hydrated adolescents was notably better, with an average score of 100.38 ± 12.01,  while dehydrated individuals had an average score of 92.00 ± 13.63 (Tung et al., 2020).\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | D OI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849812  36  The research emphasised that plain water is the main source o f hydration, with an average  intake of 877.00 ± 492.08 mL per day. This is followed by malted drinks and sweetened juice beverages.  However, beverages that contain added sugars, like soft drinks and sweetened tea, were frequently  consumed and linked to adv erse effects on cognitive function. Regression analysis showed that soft  drinks (β = −0.009; P < 0.05) and sweetened tea (β = −0.019; P < 0.05) are important negative factors  affecting cognitive scores. Even though it is suggested that individuals should d rink between 2,000 and  2,200 mL of fluids each day, only 29.6% of the participants met this guideline (Tung et al., 2020). This  shows that there is a significant difference in hydration habits among adolescents.  Hydration plays a crucial role in various b odily functions, including regulating temperature,  supporting cognitive processes, maintaining kidney function, aiding digestion, and promoting healthy  skin. Insufficient water intake can lead to adverse health outcomes such as impaired cognitive function,  fatigue, headaches, increased risk of kidney stones, and constipation. Mild dehydration, defined as a  loss of more than 2% of body weight, is commonly associated with fatigue and decreased alertness.  Proper hydration supports key cognitive functions, enha ncing memory, attention, and mood (Liska et  al., 2019). Acute water intake has been shown to improve visual attention and episodic memory,  highlighting its importance in maintaining mental performance.  The amount of water a person should drink each day ca n differ due to various reasons, such as  their gender, how active they are, the climate they live in, and any health issues they may have.  Healthline states that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommend that  men should drink   around 3.7 litres (15.5 cups) of water each day, whereas women should target about  2.7 litres (11.5 cups). These guidelines encompass all liquids obtained from both drinks and food items.  However, certain situations such as intense physical activity, hot c limates, or specific health issues may  require a higher intake of water. The \\\"8×8\\\" rule, which suggests that individuals should drink eight 8 -  ounce glasses of water each day, is a well - known guideline. However, it may not suit everyone.  Indicators that sho w whether a person is properly hydrated include feeling thirsty and checking the  colour of urine. If the urine is pale yellow, it means hydration is good, while darker urine suggests that  more fluids are needed (Gunnars, 2023) .  Table   1.   Guidelines of dail y water intake  ASPECT   DETAILS  Recommended Daily Intake   •   Men: 3.7 liters (15.5 cups)  •   Women: 2.7 liters (11.5 cups)  Inclusion   •   Includes all fluids from beverages and food  Factors Affecting Intake   •   Physical activity  •   Climate (hot weather increases need)  •   Overall health (e.g., fever, infections)  Special Considerations   •   Intense exercise  •   Hot climates  •   Certain health conditions\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | D OI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849812  37  8×8 Rule   •   Common guid eline (eight 8 - ounce glasses of   water daily)  but not suitable for everyone  Practical Hydration Indicators   •   Thirst  •   Urine   color:   Pale   yellow   indicates   good   hydration;  darker urine suggests more water is needed  Based on the LaFata research, compared to drinking room - temperature water   (22°C), drinking  cold water (4°C) during exercise reduced the rate at which body temperature rose. Compared to those  who drank room - temperature water (1.13°C), those who drank cold water had a lesser increase in core  temperature (0.83°C). This indicates th at while they were exercising, cold water kept their bodies colder  for longer. About half of the participants performed better when using cold water for certain activity  categories, such as leaping and endurance (time to fatigue on a bike). These gains, ne vertheless, weren\\\'t  substantial enough to qualify as statistically significant. In contrast, individuals who drank room -  temperature water did somewhat better on the bench press test, although the difference was negligible.  By the end of the workout, both g roups — those consuming room - temperature and cold water — were  dehydrated. This demonstrates that although cold water aids in temperature regulation, dehydration  may still occur if insufficient water intake is maintained .  4. DISCUSSION  The results highlight the important necessity for measures to encourage adequate hydration  and decrease the consumption of sugar - sweetened beverages (SSBs). The thermoelectric heating and  cooling bottle meets this requirement by providing features that enh ance the appeal of plain water and  nutritious beverages. The ability to regulate the temperature of liquids makes water more attractive in  different climates, leading people to prefer water instead of sugar - sweetened beverages. The device  also has hydratio n timers and consumption trackers. These features help monitor hydration effectively,  which is important for keeping cognitive performance at its best. The bottle includes notifications and  reminders that assist users in staying hydrated at regular interva ls. This feature helps improve mental  clarity and decreases the chances of experiencing fatigue and mood issues that can be associated with  dehydration. The bottle can heat and cool liquids, which makes it useful for various needs. It can also  help teach y oung people about the importance of staying hydrated.  This innovation is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 3, which  focusses on Good Health and Well - being, and Goal 12, which emphasises Responsible Consumption  and Production . Encouraging people to drink more water helps reduce the waste created by single - use  beverage containers, which promotes responsible consumption. Staying hydrated has several health  benefits. It can improve cognitive function and overall well - being, which   helps in promoting good  health. Additionally, the bottle can keep drinks at the desired temperatures, which increases its  usefulness by making it more pleasant to stay hydrated. Drinking cold water is important for regulating  body temperature during exerc ise. It helps manage core body temperature and can delay feelings of  fatigue caused by heat, especially in moderate to hot climates. Cold water might not have a major  impact on power or strength exercises, but it can help with temperature regulation, which   is beneficial  for endurance activities. This thermoelectric bottle provides a new and eco - friendly way to stay  hydrated. It helps people drink more water while also encouraging care for the environment and  healthier habits in the community. With this, bas ed on the research the modelling of the product is  depicted as below Figure 1, that visualizes the 3D concept of the water bottle, as well as Figure 2 that  visualizes the 2D concept of the water bo ttle.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | D OI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849812  38  Figure 1.   3D prototype of the Temper water bottle  Figure 2 .   2 D proto type of the Temper water bottle.  5. CONCLUSION  The thermoelectric heating and cooling bottle helps people stay hydrated and also reduces the  need   for   sugary   drinks.   It   provides   features   like   temperature   control,   hydration   timers,   and  consumption tracking, which help ensure regular water intake and enha nce cognitive performance and\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | D OI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849812  39  overall health. This device supports Sustainable Development Goals by promoting responsible  consumption and minimising waste from single - use containers. Moreover, its capacity to control core  body temperature while exercising   makes it an important resource for improving endurance and  comfort in different weather conditions. The thermoelectric bottle is a new and eco - friendly option that  helps people stay hydrated and encourages healthier habits in their daily lives .

INTRODUCTION  The increasing globalisation of   industries and the rapid advancement of technology in the 21st  century have heightened the demand for engineers with strong communication skills in English  (Abdullah et al., 2020). English, as the lingua franca of science, technology, and global business,   is\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19 | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849936  41  essential for engineers to collaborate, innovate, and excel in their careers (Al - Husseini, 2018). However,  many matriculation engineering students face challenges in acquiring effective language skills,  particularly speaking,   writing, and reading (Jones   & Taylor, 2018). This paper focuses on the  development   of   an   English   Language   Bootcamp   Module   designed   to   enhance   the   linguistic  competencies of future engineers, addressing specific gaps in speaking, writing, and reading (Smith,  2020).  1.1   Problem Statem ent  While engineering students possess technical expertise, their lack of proficiency in English  often   hinders   their   ability   to   communicate   complex   ideas   effectively.   Research   indicates   that  engineering students struggle with professional writing,   technical reading comprehension, and verbal  presentations. This issue is especially pronounced among matriculation students transitioning to  tertiary education, where English is the medium of instruction for most engineering courses. The gap  between their   technical skills and language proficiency creates barriers to academic success and future  employability. A targeted, intensive module is thus necessary to bridge this gap and equip students  with the communication skills required for their academic and prof essional journeys.  1.2   Research Objectives  1.   To identify the specific language needs of matriculation engineering students in speaking,  writing, and reading.  2.   To develop an English Language Bootcamp Module tailored to these needs.  3.   To evaluate the module\\\'s eff ectiveness in enhancing students\\\' language skills.  2.   LITERATURE REVIEW  2.1   The Role of English in Engineering  English is integral to engineering education and practice. Studies by Al - Husseini (2018)  emphasize the importance of English for engineers in pa rticipating in international projects and  accessing scientific literature. Engineering communication often involves writing technical reports,  delivering   presentations,   and   comprehending   complex   texts — skills   requiring   strong   English  proficiency.  2. 2   Challe nges Faced by Engineering Students  According to Abdullah et al. (2020), engineering students in non - native English - speaking  countries face significant challenges in technical writing and public speaking due to inadequate  exposure and practice. Studies high light the need for targeted interventions to address these gaps  during the foundational years of education.  2.3   Pedagogical Approaches to Language Learning  Interactive and immersive methodologies have been shown to improve language acquisition.  Task - based   learning,   as   discussed   by   Ellis   (2003),   and   intensive   boot   camp   models   provide  opportunities for learners to practice real - world tasks in supportive environments. Moreover, the  integration of technology in language modules, such as the use of simulation to ols and online  collaborative platforms, has demonstrated positive outcomes in enhancing language skills (Reinders &  White, 2016).\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19 | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849936  42  3 . METHOD & MATERIAL  3.1   Participants  The participants of the study were 30 matriculation engineering students from diverse  li nguistic backgrounds, enrolled in a two - day intensive boot camp English Language Immersive  program.  3.2   Module Development  The module was designed based on a needs analysis conducted through surveys and  interviews with students and faculty. The content fo cused on three components:  1.   Speaking: Role - plays, group discussions, and presentation skills.  2.   Writing: Technical report writing, academic writing, and reflective journals.  3.   Reading: Comprehension of engineering texts and critical reading strategies.  3.3   I mplementation  The boot camp comprised daily sessions, each lasting 10 hours, with an equal emphasis on  speaking, writing, and reading. Participants engaged in individual and collaborative tasks, supported  by peer and instructor feedback.  3.4   Data Collectio n  A survey questionnaire was distributed at the end of the boot camp sessions. Selected  participants were interviewed to get feedback about their overall experiences.  4 . FINDINGS  4.1   Objective 1 : To identify the specific language needs of matriculation   engineering students in speaking,  writing, and reading  The findings revealed that matriculation engineering students struggled significantly with all  three language components:  Speaking   Needs:   Students   faced   difficulties   in   articulating   technical   ideas   cle arly   and  confidently during verbal presentations. This aligns with Jones and Taylor’s (2018) findings that  language barriers impede effective oral communication in technical fields.  Writing Needs: Students often demonstrated poor organization and grammatic al errors in  technical   writing   tasks.   Abdullah   et   al.   (2020)   highlighted   similar   struggles   in   academic   and  professional writing among engineering students.  Reading Needs: Challenges in comprehending engineering - specific texts were evident. These  difficulti es limited their ability to extract key information and critically analyze technical documents,  consistent   with   Al - Husseini’s   (2018)   emphasis   on   reading comprehension   as   a cornerstone   of  professional success.  4.2   Objective 2 : To develop an English Language   Bootcamp Module tailored to these needs  The module\\\'s design directly addressed these identified gaps:\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19 | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849936  43  Speaking: Role - plays and group discussions allowed students to practice real - world scenarios,  boosting their confidence and fluency.  Writing:   Structured   exercises   focused   on   report   writing,   email   drafting,   and   reflective  journaling, with iterative feedback to improve clarity and coherence.  Reading: Intensive tasks on interpreting technical texts and applying critical reading strategies  were integrated to e nhance comprehension.  This task - based approach aligns with Ellis (2003) and Reinders & White (2016), who advocate  for immersive and interactive methodologies in language learning.  4.3   Objective 3 : To evaluate the effectiveness of the module in enhancing st udents\\\' language skills  The module demonstrated significant improvements across all components, as evidenced by  pre -   and post - assessment data:  Speaking: A 30% increase in clarity and confidence during presentations indicated the  module’s success in address ing verbal communication gaps.  Writing: Post - assessments showed a 40% reduction in grammatical errors, reflecting improved  proficiency in technical writing.  Reading: Students’ reading comprehension improved by 25%, as they were better able to  extract key i nformation from technical texts.  Qualitative data from reflective logs revealed heightened student motivation and confidence,  further validating the module’s impact. These findings resonate with Smith (2020) and Benson (2001),  who   emphasize   the   importance   of   targeted   interventions   in   fostering   learner   autonomy   and  communication skills.  5 . DISCUSSION  The results of the study revealed several significant insights, aligning with the research  objectives and existing literature. The English Language Bootcamp Mo dule effectively addressed the  language needs of matriculation engineering students in speaking, writing, and reading.  5.1   Alignment with Research Objective 1: Identifying Specific Language Needs  The study identified that students faced challenges in oral articulation, technical writing, and  comprehending engineering texts. These findings are consistent with Abdullah et al. (2020) and Al -  Husseini (2018), who reported similar difficulties among engi neering students in non - native English -  speaking contexts. The needs analysis emphasized the necessity of task - based learning interventions to  enhance communication skills.  5.2   Alignment with Research Objective 2: Developing a Tailored Module  The bootcamp m odule’s design incorporated interactive speaking tasks, structured writing  exercises, and intensive reading strategies, addressing these specific needs. The task - based learning  approach, as supported by Ellis (2003), created an engaging learning environmen t, enabling students  to relate their language tasks to real - world engineering scenarios. Additionally, integrating feedback\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19 | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849936  44  mechanisms improved their self - assessment and skill refinement capabilities, aligning with Reinders  and White’s (2016) findings on t he effectiveness of technology in language education.  5.3   Alignment with Research Objective 3: Evaluating Effectiveness  Quantitative and qualitative data revealed substantial improvements in language skills across  all components. The 30% increase in speaki ng proficiency and the 40% reduction in grammatical errors  in writing highlight the module’s impact. Furthermore, a 25% improvement in reading comprehension  indicates the effectiveness of critical reading strategies. These findings corroborate Smith (2020)   and  Jones & Taylor (2018), who emphasized the benefits of intensive language programs in fostering learner  autonomy and communication skills.  5.4   Challenges and Future Directions  Despite these successes, the study identified challenges such as varying pro ficiency levels and  limited   time.   These   findings   suggest   the   need   for   adaptive   learning   technologies   to   provide  differentiated instruction and ensure equitable skill development. Extending the duration of the  program and incorporating follow - up sessions co uld also sustain and enhance the improvements  observed. The findings align with Littlewood’s (1999) recommendations for ongoing scaffolding to  achieve long - term competency.  The findings align with previous studies on the effectiveness of intensive language   modules in  addressing specific learner needs. The success of the bootcamp can be attributed to its interactive, task -  based design and alignment with real - world engineering scenarios. By integrating speaking, writing,  and reading components, the module pro vided a holistic approach to language learning, enabling  students to develop practical communication skills.  However,   challenges   such   as   varying   proficiency   levels   among   participants   and   time  constraints highlight the need for differentiated instruction an d extended support. Future iterations of  the module could incorporate adaptive learning technologies to cater to individual needs and include  follow - up sessions for sustained skill development.  5. CONCLUSION  The findings from this study underscore the imp ortance of targeted interventions, such as the  English   Language   Bootcamp   Module,   in   addressing   language   skill   gaps   among   matriculation  engineering students. By focusing on speaking, writing, and reading, the module provided a holistic  and practical approac h to language learning. The 30% improvement in speaking skills, 40% reduction  in grammatical errors in writing, and 25% better reading comprehension highlight the effectiveness of  this tailored approach.  Aligning with the literature, the study confirms tha t task - based, interactive modules can  effectively enhance communication skills, particularly in a technical context (Ellis, 2003; Reinders &  White, 2016). The integration of real - world engineering scenarios further ensured relevance and  engagement for the   students, preparing them for academic success and professional demands (Smith,  2020).  Future research should explore the scalability of such modules and their long - term impact on  students\\\' academic and career outcomes. Incorporating adaptive learning techn ologies and follow - up  sessions could further improve the module’s effectiveness. Overall, this study contributes to the\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19 | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14849936  45  growing body of evidence supporting innovative and practical approaches to language education for  future engineers.  The English Language   Bootcamp Module for Future Engineers successfully addressed key  gaps in language skills among matriculation engineering students. By focusing on speaking, writing,  and reading, the module equipped students with essential communication competencies require d for  their   academic   and professional pursuits.   The findings underscore the importance of targeted  interventions in language education and provide a replicable model for similar contexts. Future  research should explore the long - term impact of such modules   and their scalability across different  educational settings.  While engineering students possess technical expertise, their lack of proficiency in English  often   hinders   their   ability   to   communicate   complex   ideas   effectively.   Research   indicates   that  engineer ing students struggle with professional writing, technical reading comprehension, and verbal  presentations. This issue is especially pronounced among matriculation students transitioning to  tertiary education, where English is the medium of instruction for   most engineering courses. The gap  between their technical skills and language proficiency creates barriers to academic success and future  employability. A targeted, intensive module is thus necessary to bridge this gap and equip students  with the communic ation skills required for their academic and professional journeys.

PENGENALAN  Berdasarkan pengalaman mengajar selama 19 tahun,   inovasi merupakan salah satu cara terbaik  untuk menangani masalah dalam pembelajaran. Inovasi dalam pendidikan mencakup perubahan yang  bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kemampuan dalam mencapai tujuan pendidikan (Aan Ansori &  Ahmad Fitriyadi, 2020). Sepanjang 3   tahun kebelakang an ini mengajar Sains Tahun 5, penulis  menyedari bahawa topik Sistem Peredaran Darah Manusia sering menjadi cabaran bagi guru dalam  menjelaskan   dan   memahamkan   beberapa   murid.   Meskipun   topik   tersebut   seharusnya   mudah  dipahami,   namun   pengaja r   perlu   meluangkan   waktu   ekstra   untuk   menjelaskan   dengan   lebih  mendalam.  Sebahagian murid mengalami kesulitan dalam menjelaskan fungsi setiap bahagian utama yang  terlibat dalam sistem peredaran darah. Mereka kerap keliru dalam memahami fungsi bahagian dan  cenderung memberikan jawapan yang tidak tepat apabila ditanya secara spontan. Selain itu, mereka  juga menghadapi kesulitan dalam menjawab soal latihan dengan betul. Kemampuan murid untuk  memahami konsep juga dapat dilihat dari kepastian jawapan yang mereka   berikan terhadap suatu  pertanyaan (Nurhafidhah dan Hasby, 2018).\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853811  47  Untuk mengatasi cabaran tersebut,   penulis   telah mencuba menjalankan sebuah projek kreatif  berupa aktiviti melukis laluan peredaran darah (lihat buku teks Sains T ahun 5, halaman 32). Namun,  p enulis   mendapati bahawa beberapa murid masih mengalami kesulitan dalam melukis   laluan  peredaran darah dengan betul, menunjukkan bahawa usaha ini belum sepenuhnya berjaya .  Rajah 1.   Aktiviti kreatif Melakar Laluan Peredaran Darah  Berdasarkan aktiviti   kreatif m elukis laluan peredaran darah, g uru bertanya mengapa mereka  tidak dapat m enjawab dengan tepat. B erikut adalah jawapan murid:     Jawapan murid pertama: \\\"Saya tidak pasti laluan darah mana yang membawa oksigen dan  yang membawa karbon dioksida.\\\"     Jawapan   murid kedua: \\\"Saya tidak faham laluan darah yang menghubungkan paru - paru dan  jantung.\\\"  Walaupun guru telah berusaha menjelaskan kembali topik tersebut, namun sebahagian murid  masih memberikan jawapan yang s alah. Berdasarkan masalah ini, penulis   percaya pe ndekatan yang  berbeza perlu diambil supaya masalah murid tidak berterusan .  1.1   Fokus Kajian  Kajian yang dijalankan adalah berfokus unt uk menambah baik amalan PdP   dalam mengajar  murid tahun 5 Adil untuk menguasai tajuk Sistem Peredaran Darah Manusia dengan meng gunakan  Papan Interak tif SPDM. Dalam kajian ini, penulis   memfokuskan subtopik fungsi organ dan bahagian  utama serta laluan peredaran darah manusia dalam silibus matapelajaran Sains Tahun 5 .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853811  48  1.2   Tujuan Kajian  Tu juan kajian ini adalah untuk menambahbaik amalan P dP   bagi menerangkan fungsi organ  dan menentukan arah laluan darah dalam sistem peredaran darah manusia, murid tahun 5 Adil  dengan menggunakan inovasi Papan Interaktif SPDM.  Di samping itu juga, objektif kajian ini adalah seperti berikut, iaitu murid - murid   dapat:     Menyatakan fungsi jantung, peparu, salur darah dan darah, dalam sistem peredaran darah  manusia.     Menentukan arah laluan darah lebih oksigen dan arah laluan darah lebih karbon dioksida  dalam sistem peredaran darah manusia .  2.   KAEDAH & BAHAN  2.1   Soalan   Kajian  Bagaimana   guru   menambah   baik   amalan   PdP   dalam   menerangkan   fungsi   organ   dan  mementukan arah laluan darah dalam sistem peredaran darah manusia, murid tahun 5 Adil dengan  menggunakan inovasi Papan Interaktif SPDM .  2.2   Kumpulan Sasaran  Kajian ini melibatkan   seramai 6 orang murid tahun 5 Adil SK Seri Duyong, Melaka yang terdiri  daripada 1 orang murid lelaki dan 5 orang murid perempuan .  2.3   Kaedah Kajian  Penulis   telah   memilih   Reka   Bentuk   Kajian   Tindakan   Kemmis   &   Mc   Taggart   dalam  melaksanakan kajian   s eperti berikut :  Rajah 2 .   Model Kajian Tindakan   Kemmis & Mc   Taggart .  Penulis   menggunakan 3 kaedah untuk mengumpul data dalam kajian ini. Kaedah tersebut  ialah pemerhatian, semakan dokumen dan temu bual.   Ketiga - tiga kaedah yang digunakan iaitu  pemerhatian, semakan   dokumen dan temu bual dianalisis secara deskriptif berbentuk naratif.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853811  49  3.   TINDAKAN YANG DIJALA NKAN / INTERVENSI  Papan Interaktif SPDM melibatkan dua intervensi terhadap dua standard pembelajaran dalam  topik Sistem Peredaran Darah Manusia iaitu:  Jadual   1.   Standard Kandungan dan Standard Pembelajaran yang terlibat .  Standard  Kandungan  Standard Pembelajaran  2.2   2.2.1   Memerihal fungsi bahagian utama yang terlibat dalam sistem peredaran  darah manusia.  2.2.2   Melakar laluan peredaran darah yang lebih oksigen   dan laluan  peredaran darah yang lebih karbon dioksida dalam tubuh manusia.  Bagi standard pembelajaran 2.2.1, Papan Interaktif SPDM dilengkapi dengan keterangan  fungsi bahagian utama yang terlibat dalam sistem peredaran darah manusia. Organ - organ   tersebut  telah dilabel dengan anak panah hijau. Ia bersifat boleh laras, supaya guru boleh juga menggunakan  model ini untuk menjalankan aktiviti secara dalam kumpulan ataupun individu bagi menguji  kefahaman murid tentang fungsi bahagian utama dalam sistem   peredaran darah manusia. Berikut  ialah jadual fungsi bahagian utama dalam sistem peredaran darah manusia.  Jadual   2 .   Fungsi bahagian utama dalam sistem peredaran darah .  Bahagian  Utama  Jantung   Peparu   Salur Darah   Darah  Fungsi   Organ yang  mengepam darah  ke   peparu dan ke  seluruh bahagian  tubuh.  Organ yang menjadi  tempat pertukaran  antara gas oksigen  dengan gas karbon  dioksida.  Tiub laluan untuk  darah mengalir.  Mengangkut  darah ke seluruh  bahagian tubuh.  Mengangkut  oksigen, nutrien,  air dan bahan  kumuh.  Bagi   standard pembelajaran 2.2.2 pula, penggunaan Papan Interaktif SPDM melibatkan  strategi pembelajaran visual berpusatkan murid dengan penerapan konsep warna. Menurut Dzulkifli  dan Mustafar (2013), warna merupakan pengalaman visual yang paling signifikan bag i manusia.  Warna - warna   tertentu   mampu   mempengaruhi   ingatan   terhadap   maklumat   yang   dilihat   atau  dipelajari. Penggunaan warna turut memudahkan proses mengingat semula maklumat, sama ada yang  tersimpan dalam ingatan jangka pendek atau jangka panjang.  Kanak - kanak cenderung tertarik kepada alat bantu mengajar interaktif yang menggabungkan  elemen warna dan cahaya. Berdasarkan mina t dan kecenderungan murid, penulis   terinspirasi untuk  menggabungkan inovasi interaktif dengan strategi pembelajaran visual seba gai pendekatan un tuk  menangani masalah murid . Hal ini selaras dengan dapa tan kajian Nurannisaa   (2017), yang menyatakan  bahawa pembelajaran visual membantu pelajar berfikir secara kritis, di mana maklumat verbal dan  visual   yang   berkaitan   dapat   membantu   pela jar   membuat   hubungan,   memahami   kaitan,   dan  mengingati semula butiran yang relevan. Elemen warna yang diterapkan pada Papan Interaktif SPDM  membantu murid - murid membayangkan menggunakan visual bagi arah aliran yang b erbeza.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853811  50  Kelipan warna lampu LED   berasas kan kod - kod warna seperti berikut:  Lampu LED merah   : Laluan darah lebih oksigen  Lampu LED biru   : Laluan darah lebih karbon dioksida  Laluan darah lebih oksigen bermula dari paru - paru dan mengalir masuk ke jantung. Dari situ,  darah lebih oksigen dipamkan ke   seluruh tubuh manusia. Darah lebih oksigen ini juga membawa  nutrien dan air yang penting untuk fungsi tubuh. Apabila bahagian tubuh menggunakan oksigen  dalam darah dan menghasilkan karbon dioksida, laluan darah yang kaya dengan oksigen akan  bertukar kepad a laluan darah yang kaya dengan karbon dioksida. Laluan darah ini bermula dari tubuh  dan menuju ke jantung, di mana darah tersebut kemudian dipamkan semula ke paru - paru. Proses  pertukaran gas oksigen dan karbon dioksida akan berlaku di dalam peparu semasa   proses pernafasan.  Kitaran ini akan berlaku secara berterusan sehingga hayat manusia masih ada.  Rajah 3 .   Papan Interaktif SPDM .  3.1   Pelaksanaan Intervensi 1  Intervensi 1 dijalankan dengan tujuan untuk menguji kebolehan murid dalam memahami  fungsi - fungsi ja ntung, peparu, salur darah, dan darah dalam sistem peredaran darah, serta untuk  memahami proses peredaran darah yang berulang setiap kali manusia bernafas.  Bagi mengingatkan semula pelajaran yang lalu tentang topik ini, guru terlebih dahulu  menjelaskan fun gsi setiap organ dan bahagian utama, iaitu jantung, peparu, salur darah, dan darah.  Kemudian, murid - murid berbincang secara berpasangan untuk melabel organ dan bahagian utama  dalam sistem peredaran darah. Seterusnya, mereka melabel dan menampalkan fungsi o rgan serta\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853811  51  bahagian utama tersebut pada Papan Interaktif SPDM. Selepas itu, sebagai kaedah pentaksiran, setiap  murid diberi lembaran kerja individu.  Rajah 4 .   Murid dikehendaki menampal jawapan yang   betul pada ruangan yang disediakan .  3.1.1   Analisis Intervensi 1  Sepanjang intervensi 1, murid dapat mengenal pasti fungsi bahagian utama dalam sistem  peredaran darah dengan tepat dan betul. Mereka menunjukkan keupayaan untuk melaksanakan tugas  dengan cekap tanp a memerlukan perbincangan yang panjang, dan dapat memberikan jawapan dalam  tempoh masa yang singkat. Ketika melakukan aktiviti, mereka kelihatan yakin dan puas dengan  jawapan yang diberikan. Selain itu, semasa menjalankan latihan dalam lembaran kerja, muri d mampu  memberikan jawapan yang tepat tanpa perlu bergantung kepada rakan sebaya. Ini menunjukkan  kebolehan mereka untuk bekerja secara mandiri setelah memahami konsep tersebut .  3.2   Pelaksanaan Intervensi 2  Intervensi 2 bertujuan untuk menilai keupayaan murid   dalam mengingati arah laluan darah  lebih oksigen dan arah laluan darah lebih karbon dioksida dengan men ggunakan Papan Interaktif  SPDM.  Pertama sekali, murid akan menekan suis lampu (warna merah) untuk melihat laluan darah  lebih oksigen berkelip. Murid aka n diberi masa untuk memerhati laluan tersebut mengikut arah  kelipan lampu sambil mendengar keterangan dari guru .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853811  52  Rajah 5 .   Murid memerhati kerlipan lampu LED merah yang mewakili laluan peredaran darah lebih oksigen .  Kemudian, murid akan menekan suis   lampu (warna biru) untuk melihat laluan darah lebih  karbon dioksida. Murid akan terus mendengar proses berikutnya dari keterangan guru.  Rajah 6 .   Murid memerhati kerlipan lampu LED biru yang mewakili laluan peredaran darah lebih karbon  dioksida .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853811  53  Kemudi an,   dalam   keadaan   lampu   LED   yang   masih   menyala,   murid   secara   individu  menjelaskan kembali laluan peredaran darah yang lengkap berpandukan kerlipan lampu LED merah  dan biru tersebut.  Selepas   itu,   kedua - dua   lampu   LED   tersebut   dimatikan.   Murid   akan   diminta   un tuk  menempatkan   anak panah   mengikuti   laluan   darah   yang   betul berdasarkan   warna   yang   telah  ditetapkan pada Papan Interaktif SPDM iaitu anak panah merah bagi laluan darah lebih oksigen dan  lampu biru bagi laluan darah lebih karbon dioksida.  Sebagai langkah   pentaksiran, murid akan diminta untuk melukis laluan darah lebih oksigen  dan laluan darah lebih karbon dioksida pada lembaran kerja yang diberikan .  Rajah 7 .   Murid meletakkan anak panah merah dan biru   pada laluan peredaran darah .  3.2.1   Analisis Intervensi Aktiviti 2  Sepanjang intervensi 2, murid - murid menunjukkan minat yang mendalam dan memberikan  fokus sepenuhnya. Mereka sangat teruja memerhatikan kerlipan lampu merah dan biru yang menyala  secara berurutan.   Apabila suis lampu dimatikan, mereka dapat menempatkan anak panah dengan  tepat pada arah laluan darah lebih oksigen dan laluan darah lebih karbon dioksida. Mereka juga saling  membantu untuk mendapatkan jawapan yang betul. Selain itu, murid - murid dapat men yelesaikan  tugasan individu mereka dengan melukis laluan peredaran darah dengan tepat pada lembaran kerja  yang diberika n.  3.3   Refleksi Intervensi  Sungguh menggembirakan melihat keseriusan dan minat murid - murid dalam menjalankan  aktiviti 1 dan 2 secara berpasan gan. Mereka menunjukkan ketekunan dan kesungguhan dalam fokus  pada tugas yang diberikan, serta mampu memahami dengan baik setiap fungsi bahagian utama dalam  sistem peredaran darah manusia.  Kemahiran mereka menentukan arah laluan darah yang mengandungi leb ih oksigen dan  laluan darah lebih karbon dioksida dengan tepat, tanpa bantuan langsung dari guru, menunjukkan\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853811  54  tahap pemahaman yang sangat baik. Sikap yakin yang mereka tunjukkan adalah bukti jelas bahawa  mereka telah menguasai objektif pembelajaran ini.  Da lam topik Sistem Peredaran Darah Manusia, guru tidak dapat menunjukkan perjalanan  sistem yang sebenar tanpa menggunakan aplikasi interaktif. Ini kerana ia melibatkan organ dalaman  manusia yang sebenar, yang mana murid tidak dapat menyentuh atau melihatnya   secara langsung.  Oleh itu, penggunaan aplikasi interaktif sangat diperlukan dalam pengajaran topik ini. Melalui  aktiviti ini telah dapat meningkatkan kefahaman dan pencapaian murid dalam topik ini, s elari dengan  dapatan Zur’ain   & Abdul Raz ak   (2022) yang m enyatakan bahawa penggunaan aplikasi interaktif  mampu menarik minat murid, memberi motivasi kepada pelajar untuk belajar, serta meningkatkan  pencapaian mereka.  Kejayaan intervensi ini dalam menangani masalah yang dihadapi oleh murid tela h terbukti.  Oleh it u, penulis   bercadang untuk memperluaskan kaedah intervensi ini kepada kelas - kelas lain yang  mungkin menghada pi masalah serupa. Selain itu, penulis   juga berhasrat untuk berkongsi kaedah  intervensi ini dengan rakan - rakan guru Sains di sekolah lain, dengan ha rapan dapat memberi manfaat  yang sama kepada lebih ramai pelajar.  4.

DAPATAN   KAJIAN DAN PERBINCAN GAN  6.1 Dapatan Pentaksiran Formatif  Berdasarkan   dapatan,   keputusan   pentaksiran   formatif   menunjukkan   intervensi   yang  digunakan telah menambah baik amalan saya mengajar topik Sistem Peredaran Darah Manusia  dengan menggunakan inovasi Papan Interaktif SPDM. Keputusan pentaksiran murid mengalami  peningkatan ketara setelah saya menggunakan inovasi dalam topik ini.  Penulis mendapati   inovasi dalam pembelajaran sangat sesuai dilaksanakan kerana setiap  murid mempunyai kecerdasan yang berbeza. Suasana pembelajaran yang mengintegrasikan unsur -  unsur kece rdasan pelbagai adalah kondusif dan berjaya memperkembangkan sikap saintifik dan nilai  murni, serta unsur - unsur kecerdasan p elbagai dalam kalangan pelajar (Othman   & Yaakub, 2 010).

Penggunaan lampu LED berkerlip dalam inovasi ini juga membantu murid mengenalpasti laluan  darah lebih oksigen dan laluan darah lebih karbon dioksida dengan tepat.  Sesi pembelajaran berlangsung dalam   keadaan aktif dan penuh   semangat.   Murid juga  menunju kkan kefokusan yang sepenuhnya dalam sesi pembelajaran.   Ini membuktikan bahawa  pembelajaran aktif meningkatkan kefahaman dan penglibatan pelajar, yang seterusnya mencetuskan  suasana pembelajaran yang lebih aktif dan fokus. Ini selari denga n dapatan kajian   Deslauriers, et a l .  (2019).  6.3   Dapatan Analisis Temubual  Berdasarkan temubual yang telah dijalankan, ia menunjukkan bahawa   inovasi ini dapat  membantu penulis   dalam meningkatkan amalan PdP di dalam kelas. Kajian oleh Mohd Khairulnizam  Ramlie ,   et al. (2023) menyatakan bahawa guru yang menggunakan inovasi cenderung menjadikan  pembelajaran lebih dinamik dan efisien, serta memahami keperluan pelajar.

The researchers tried to help by proposing ArtChain:  GUHIT Pinas\\\' Centralized Art Managemen t System with Blockchain Technology. The main feature of the bundle  is the use of both blockchain and Non - Fungible Token (NFT) to provide a secure ledger and smooth transactions.  The platform has the functionalities for Google Lens Application Programming   Interface (API), which can scan for  plagiarism, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) a decentralized storage system, and the possibility of direct sale and  online auctions.   Based on a survey filled in by 50 GUHIT Pinas members, it was found out that 96% were   mainly  approved, 98% were in favor of blockchain - based solutions. The system was also checked with a model provided by  ISO 25010, and this also testified about the highest level of functionality, usability, and security, increasing the  system new potential . The new reality led to artist gain more efficiency in their workflow, better interaction, and  more exposure of their work to the public.   This study was conducted in order to show the capability of blockchains  when it comes to art management, it can be ve ry transparent, trustworthy. Thus, artists can also earn and be  protected from unauthorized third - party utilization of their creative work. As a pioneering digital art landscape in  the Philippines and in the art management system, ArtChain has set a new be nchmark.

INTRODUCTION  In a world where technology is rapidly advancing, transactions and records are continually  improving and shifting toward digital solutions. Blockchain is one of the disruptive innovations that  provides strong solutions to secure contracts, secure transacti ons, and data management in its  decentralized way to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and transparency. In today\\\'s digital era,  artists find new ways to showcase and sell their work, reaching a wider audience than ever before. The  way that buyers an d sellers of artwork connect and do business is completely changed by blockchain  technology in the art industry. Also, blockchain technology makes it possible to create digital  certificates of authenticity, which brings a more effective and transparent met hod of transferring  ownership of works of art. This has diminished the artists\\\' challenge in the virtual realm from fighting  for continuous income amidst uncertainty to less of a problem. OpenSea is one of these blockchain\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853813  59  technologies that allows users to   buy, sell, and trade digital products such as NFTs (non - fungible  tokens) on a decentralized platform, and it has become a go - to platform for those looking to invest in  digital art or unique digital collectibles. Additionally, the platform\\\'s use of blockch ain technology  ensures transparency and security in all transactions, giving users peace of mind when buying and  selling NFTs (Finzer and Atallah, 2017).  However, there are still challenges in the art world, as many artists are missing out on the  benefits   of blockchain technology. It requires a significant amount of energy to process transactions.  More artists are wary of the lack of physical ownership that comes with buying and selling digital art,  as it can be easily replicated and distributed without th eir consent. One of these issues is the concern of  ownership and authenticity. With traditional physical art, provenance is key in determining the value  and authenticity of a piece. However, with digital art and NFTs, provenance can be more easily  manipula ted or lost   altogether. This lack of clear provenance can lead   to issues of copyright  infringement and intellectual property theft, creating further challenges for artists in the digital art  world.  As the industry continues to evolve, finding solutions to   these challenges will be crucial in  ensuring the continued growth and success of NFTs and digital art. Despite these challenges, the  potential for growth and innovation in the digital art market with the use of NFTs and blockchain  technology will be inter esting to see how it will continue to shape the art world in the future. Despite  its potential, a significant number of artists continue to rely on traditional methods for showcasing and  selling their work, which can lead to inefficiencies. One of the majo r issues is the manual process of  tracking ownership and sales, which often involves physical documents and multiple intermediaries.  This approach can result in delays, lost records, and miscommunication between buyers, sellers, and  galleries. Additionally , the time - consuming task of verifying authenticity and transferring ownership  without digital tools increases the chances of errors and fraud. The lack of automation in these processes  means that artists may need to spend more time on administrative tasks   rather than focusing on  creating new artwork. This can hinder their productivity and limit their ability to reach a wider  audience. Adopting digital platforms and tools for managing sales and ownership can streamline the  process, reduce the risk of errors , and provide artists with more time to devote to their craft. By  embracing technology, artists can modernize their approach to selling and showcasing their work,  ultimately leading to greater efficiency and success in the art world.  Organizations or commu nity groups, including those in the art industry, are now trying to  adapt to the evolving digital situation and seeking better solutions to improve efficiency. This shift  towards a more digital approach not only benefits artists but also enhances the overa ll experience for  art enthusiasts and collectors who are now able to discover and purchase artwork more easily than ever  before.  Making use of technology is essential for staying competitive in today\\\'s fast - paced and ever -  changing art market. This platfor m makes easier the process of managing and selling digital art,  eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional manual methods. By performing tasks, such as tracking  ownership, verifying authenticity, and processing sales, the system helps reduce delays and   errors.  Blockchain technology enhances this process by providing secure, transparent, and decentralized  management, ensuring that all transactions are recorded accurately and efficiently. It offers real - time  visibility into ongoing transactions, allowing a rtists, buyers, and administrators to monitor and  improve the workflow. This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of miscommunication or lost  information. As technology continues to evolve, more industries,   including the art   world, are  embracing t hese digital solutions to optimize their workflows and achieve better results.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853813  60  People who manage centralized platforms look for ways to cut down delays and improve the  visibility of methods. The researchers found that the use of blockchain - based software   is a more reliable  solution for securing data, reducing errors, and increasing transparency than traditional methods.  Blockchain provides a decentralized system where all transactions are recorded in a secure, tamper -  proof manner, making it easier to track   ownership and authenticity in the digital art world.   The  researchers used these opportunities to solve the issues in digital art management and introduce a new  generation of innovation and trust to the GUHIT Pinas art community.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  2.1   Research Design  A quantitative type of research was used by the researchers to gather numerical data, compute  the averages, collect data, test relationships, and discuss the study’s results. The kind of quantitative  method that the researche rs utilized was a research and developmental approach, for they developed,  built, and implemented the system in their locale. Research and Developmental approaches are actions  for innovation by organizations or businesses to create new goods or improve the ir current services  (Gustiani, 2019).  2.2   Respondents  A non - probability sampling method was employed, which involves selecting units from a  population based on non - random principles (Nikolopoulou, 2022). Within this framework, purposive  and quota sampling   techniques were utilized to select a total of 50 respondents from the GUHIT Pinas  community to provide a diverse size yet manageable to allow diverse representation of all kinds of  artists while efficiently keeping the process of data collection. The samp le consisted of any artists inside  the organization. This number corresponds to the total of 50 respondents suggested for quantitative  research in small to medium populations (Andrade, 2020).  2.3   Instrument  The researchers used a survey questionnaire that was approved by the adviser and research  coordinator. The researchers also used ISO 25010 to evaluate the system\\\'s quality, such as functional  suitability,   performance   efficiency,   usability,   portability,   sec urity,   and   compatibility.   All   these  instruments were   used online and face - to - face. For the online - based,   the selected respondents will  answer via Google Forms where all the questions were there.  2.4   Data Collection  Data was collected through a pr e - survey questionnaire administered to the GUHIT Pinas  community to inform   the development   and   evaluation   of the system.   Following the system\\\'s  completion, information technology (IT) experts were engaged to conduct an evaluation using ISO  25010 to assess   the system\\\'s quality. Additionally, prior to full implementation, pilot testing of the  questionnaires and the system was conducted with selected trusted individuals to ensure reliability  and validity.  2.5   Statistical Treatment  The results of this study were analyzed using statistical methods to analyze and interpret data  about a population based on sample data. The researchers used pie charts, frequency counts, and  percentages to calculate the responses of the respondents. Addit ionally, the researchers used a 4 - point\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853813  61  Likert scale, mean, and standard deviation to interpret and analyze the collected answers from the  respondents of the study based on evaluating the system.  3. FINDINGS  The findings highlighted the significant   potential of the ArtChain platform to address the  challenges faced by GUHIT Pinas. Key results include:  3.1   Integrating blockchain technology with NFTs of ArtChain ensures secure authentication and ownership  verification of digital artworks to avoid unaut horized use and plagiarism  Fi gure 1.

Because of the lack of proper credit and unauthorized use of their artwork, 98% of artists believe that  the use of blockchain technology would enhance the protection of their ownership and ensure proper  credit for their artwork (Figure   4 ). Further more, it reveals that 98% of artists agree that a secure platform  would prevent unauthorized use of their artwork (see Figure   5 ), so this aligns directly with the objective  of the study, which is to prevent plagiarism and unauthorized usage by utilizing bl ockchain technology  and NFTs for secure ownership verification.   In response to this issue, the researchers opted to integrate  Non - Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to solve the problem.  Figure   6 .   Mint button displayed for approved artwork  Figure   4 .

Minted artwork transaction on the Polygon zkEVM blockchain  The   goal is to   integrate blockchain technology with NFTs of ArtChain that will ensure secure  authentication   and   ownership   verification   of digital   artworks   to   avoid   unauthorized   use   and  plagiarism .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853813  64  3.2   Creating monetization features within the platform that allow artists to directly earn from their work, such as  direct sales and auctioning for their artwork, facilitating sec ure transactions and offering transparent processes  that benefit both artists and buyers.  The results in Figure   9   indicate that 100% of the respondents believe a centralized platform that  offers monetization opportunities would help them manage and showcase their art portfolios. This  indicates the need for an effective platform where artists can easily display their   work while also having  the potential to earn directly from it. With this need for a centralized platform, 98% of the artists agree  that monetizing their artwork through a secure platform can benefit them not only because they want  to show their art portfol ios but also because they want ways to make money from their artwork (see  Figure   10 ). With a system where artists are eager to display and monetize their artwork, the artists  answered 100% yes (Figure   11 ), saying that they prefer a system that protects the ir work and ensures  they receive proper credit and payment.  Given the limited monetization possibilities for artists due to the problems of this marketplace,  the authors decided to have features that directly allow artists to earn from their work, for   example,  selling and auctioning their artwork on the platform. Our aim here is to include monetization features  into the platform and ensure safe transaction processes and to make it easy and transparent so that  artists and buyers benefit from such a marke tplace.

Would you prefer a system that  ensures the protection, proper credit, and  monetization of your artwork, focusing  on security and transparency?  YES  NO\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853813  65  Figure   12 .   Minted NFTs can be au c tion  Figure   13 .   Make an offer   for bidding   through   ETH   for the auctioned NFT  The system also has monetization features which enable artists to earn money directly through  auct ions and direct sales. Figure 12   demonstrates that an artist can put up their minted NFTs for an  auction, creating a competitive marketplace for his work. Fig ure 13   illustrates the \\\"Make an Offer\\\"  modal in which bidders may submit their offers in ETH for the auctioned NFTs, thereby creat ing  transparent and secure transactions. Such features will enable the artists to have a centralized platform,  showcase their work, and consequently monetize it as well, thus providing adequate   fulfilment   of  objectives in terms of giving visibility as well   as generating income for artists.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853813  66  3.3   Providing admins enough tools for faster feedback for artists such as integrating Google Lens API to  automatically detect plagiarism and verify the originality of submitted artworks for faster approval  The results in Figure   14   show that 94% of respondents have experienced delays in receiving  feedback on their submitted artworks, highlighting a significant challenge for artists in the GUHIT  Pinas community. Additionally, 92% have struggled with communication issues with moderato rs,  which negatively impacts their productivity. This emphasizes the need for a more centralized and  responsive communication system. One objective of the study is to integrate the Google Lens API to  automatically detect plagiarism and verify the originali ty of artwork, which could reduce manual  checks and enhance feedback timeliness. Artists unanimously agreed (100%) that they would benefit  from such a system.  Considering the challenge of delayed feedback and plagiarism concerns, the researchers  decided to   include tools that would allow artists to receive feedback faster. For this, our objective is to  provide admins with adequate tools, including the integration of the Google Lens API, to automatically  detect plagiarism and verify the originality of submitt ed artworks for faster approval.  94%  6%  1.

Artists page for its artworks, collection and collected NFTs  The results   in Figure   19   stated that 90% of artists in the GUHIT Pinas community found the  current artwork submission process difficult to use, indicating the need for a more user - friendly  platf orm. A platform like ArtChain, where artists can easily store and display their artworks to a wider  audience, is much desired, as stated by the 98% of respondents who agreed that a centralized system  would improve how they manage and showcase their portfol ios (Figure   20 ). Furthermore, the artists  answered 100% yes to wanting a system that protects their work, ensures proper credit, and supports  monetization. This indicates that artists have concerns about the security of their artwork and want a  platform th at will allow them to earn from their art while also showcasing their work and protecting  its ownership (Figure   1 1 ).  Because of the demand for better visibility and accessibility of artworks, the researchers  decided to create an archive for GUHIT Pinas me mbers. For this, our objective is to create a space where  members can store and show their artworks to achieve the greatest possible visibility and accessibility  to the widest audience.  4.   DISCUSSION  An overall performance evaluation of ArtChain is done   by assessing it according to the  standards ISO 25010, focusing on categories such as functional suitability, usability, security, and  reliability. Feedbacks were gathered from selected respondents from the GUHIT Pinas community that  include artists, modera tors, and technical users so that the opinions gathered are from diversified  perspectives of performance. The overall result of the evaluation showed that every category had a  mean score of more than 3.8, and the grand mean was 3.85, showing that the syste m is highly  satisfactory.   This   consistent   positive   response   shows   that   ArtChain   indeed   meets   the   users\\\'  expectations and ISO standards. The assessment concludes that ArtChain effectively addresses the  needs of the GUHIT Pinas community by providing a safe,   reliable, and user - friendly platform, ready  to support digital art management and foster an active, accessible space for artists.  Table   1 . show s a   grand mean of 3.86 across all categories, indicating strong agreement from  both GUHIT Pinas   Artists and IT Experts that the application meets the ISO 25010 standards. This  suggests that the application has successfully passed the quality assessment criteria set by the ISO 25010  model.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853813  69  Table   1 .

CONCLUSION  The researchers conclude that ArtChain: GUHIT Pinas\\\' Centralized Art Management System  with   Blockchain Technology addresses some of the major issues involved in the management of digital  arts. It employs blockchain technology and NFTs to offer artists a safe, transparent, and verified  ownership verification platform to ensure monetization possibi lities and ease in feedback processes.  This protects and empowers the GUHIT Pinas community through its safe - guarding and growth within  the digital art sphere.  The system\\\'s high degree of alignment with ISO 25010 standards, as reflected in the evaluation  r esults, further justifies its software quality and user satisfaction. ArtChain is ready to serve as an  innovative solution for the management of digital art, and it benefits not only the artists but also the  broader creative community.  Further research   should involve integrating advanced AI tools and scalable options that  improve the functionality and allow more exposure of the system to a higher population. Adapting  cutting - edge technologies makes ArtChain to remain on par with other advanced innovative   systems  that exhibit a user - friendliness within the art and technology world.

INTRODUCTION  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly   reshaping the educational landscape by introducing  innovative solutions to enhance learning experiences (Onesi - Ozigagun et al, 2024). The incorporation  of AI in education has led to personalised learning experiences tailored to individual pupil needs. In  t he realm of early childhood education, the development of writing skills is a critical component of  literacy. For Year 1 pupils, mastering the construction of basic sentences such as \\\"I’ve got\\\" and \\\"I haven’t  got\\\" is essential for their academic progressio n. Research has shown that integrating AI technologies in\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853823  72  primary education can facilitate the acquisition of language skills and improve cognitive development  in young learners.  1.1 Problem Statement  Traditional teaching methods, which often rely on stati c worksheets, have proven insufficient  in engaging young learners and fostering their creativity. These methods can lead to a lack of interest  and motivation among pupils, ultimately hindering their writing development. These traditional  approaches do not   stimulate the creativity and inclusivity required for effective learning. This gap  necessitates the development of innovative teaching tools that can address these challenges and  enhance the learning experience for young pupils.  In the context of Year 1   pupils at schools adhering to the DSKP, the need for an engaging and  effective learning tool is particularly pronounced. Teachers have observed that the conventional  methods do not adequately support pupils in mastering writing skills, especially in constr ucting  sentences like \\\"I’ve got\\\" and \\\"I haven’t got.\\\" The lack of engaging and interactive materials often results  in disengagement and poor academic performance among pupils.  Pupil engagement, which is also investigated in this study, is the key to all ty pes of learning,  not just online learning. However, the investigation into the pupils’ perceptions of their online learning  engagement is especially vital because these students no longer have access to classroom teaching and  their teachers’ roles are redu ced to that of an online facilitator. When pupils find English subjects boring  it is a sign that teachers need to be creative in making the lessons fascinating. Visualisation is the key!  The study has been inspired by a quotation by a former Education Mini ster:  “Schools and universities must become the happiest places where the learning process is, fun  so that students will love knowledge. They must also be places where differences are not just  respected but appreciated and celebrated,” (Maszlee Malik, as   cited in Chin & Pajaendram,  2019).  Addressing these challenges, PhrasePilot has been developed as an innovative digitalised  module using the ASSURE model. By integrating Artificial Intelligence of Copilot AI and Canva,  PhrasePilot offers an interactive,   technology - driven approach to learning. Copilot AI enhances the  module by providing intelligent, guided prompts and feedback, while Canva allows pupils to generate  personalised and visually appealing visuals that make learning more engaging and enjoyable.   This  module allows pupils to generate personalised visuals, respond to guided prompts, and construct  sentences with ease. Catering to diverse proficiency levels, PhrasePilot aims to foster inclusivity,  creativity, and confidence in writing while aligning s eamlessly with curriculum goals.  1.2 Aims  This paper aims to establish the effects that the developed module integrating Copilot AI has  in elevating the Year 1 ESL pupils’ language structure of I’ve got and I haven’t got while considering  the effectivenes s to boost the Year 1 pupils’ engagement and motivation in learning vocabulary through  an exciting way. This study intends to fill the identified gaps in Year 1 writing proficiency and advances  the   increasing   research   on   the   use   of   innovative   educational   p ractices   and   provide   practical  recommendations for teachers who want to use technology in their teaching approaches.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853823  73  1.3   Objective(s)  T he objectives of this study are:  i.   To explore the effectiveness of using Phrasepilot in elevating the Year 1 ESL pupils’ l anguage  structure of ‘I’ve got’ and ‘I haven’t got.  ii.   To boost the engagement, and motivation of   Year 1 pupils while using the   PhrasePilot for  vocabulary learning.  2.   METHOD   &   MATERIAL  2.1   Research Design  The researcher conducted this study by using a mixed - method data collection method, which  followed a   quasi - experimental research design.   At the same time, ASSURE model has proven useful in  developing digital materials in education (Herout, 2016; Al Ghawail , Ben Yahia, & Alrzini, 2021). Thus,  ASSURE model was applied in developing the digitalised module   improving Year   1 writing skill  named PhrasePilot. Figure 1   shows a framework of how the researchers applied   ASSURE model   in  innovating PilotPhrase.  Figure   1.   ASSURE model used in developing PhrasePilot.   ( Source : Lei,   2023).  2.2 Research Instrument  The researcher collected the data by using both quantitative and qualitative data collections.  This study was held for 4 weeks. There were 48 pupils from   primary schools from two states who joined  this research. The school is addressed as School A which is in Selangor and School B is in Pahang. The  participants   were   selected   through   purposive   sampling   whereby   participants   with   advanced,  intermediate and rem edial writing acquisition are identified through their test   Pentaksiran Bilik Darjah  (PBD)   and   mid - term   test.  The quantitative method encompassed pre - test and post - test while the qualitative method was  through participant observation. The purpose of condu cting the pre - test and post - test was to evaluate  the pupils’ ability to write using sentence structure of “I’ve got” and “I haven’t got” as before and after  the treatment. The data from   pre - test   and post data is collected demonstrates the efficacy of the\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853823  74  P hrasePilot module in enhancing English language abilities across students of diverse proficiency  levels across two schools.   Moreover, the aim of accompanying the participant observation was to  observe the pupils’ progress during the treatment phase whether   they were able to communicate,  collaborate, as well as use their critical thinking, and creativity to complete the structured writing.  The language teachers from both schools were required to mark the pre - test and post - test  essays according to the given   rubric by the researcher. In addition, the researcher designed a participant  observation checklist to observe the pupils’ activities in the classroom. The findings for quantitative  were analysed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v ersion 22 while the  participant observation’s outcomes were categorised according to common themes.  2.3   Product Demonstration  The demonstration of the product was conducted during the Year 1 Eng lish Class of Unit 4:  Lunchtime , at both primary schools. Pupils were required to move from easy to difficult tasks  throughout the lesson. There were 6 tasks to attempt in the   module.   The English teachers of the classes  acted as facilitators to assist the pupils. The pupils were given i nstructions and guidelines for using  both Copilot and Canva in   Figure 2 and Figure 3.  Figure 2.   Copilot   Figure 3.   Canva  The development and implementation of PhrasePilot   were systematically guided by the  ASSURE instructional design model, spanning a duration from October to mid - December. This  approach ensured a structured integration of the module into the teaching process while addressing  the diverse proficiency levels o f Year 1 pupils: Advanced, Intermediate, and Remedial. Each stage of  the ASSURE model was meticulously adapted to align with the learning objectives and enhance  inclusivity, engagement, and creativity in writing.   The implementation PhrasePilot incorporated  Copilot AI to provide guided sentence construction prompts and Canva to enable the creation of  personalized, interactive visuals. Customized materials, including worksheets, vocabulary banks, and  digital templates, were also employed to support the learni ng process and provide a structured  framework for all activities.  The utilisation phase saw pupils actively engaging with the module through a series of  interactive tasks. Using prompts generated by Copilot AI, pupils constructed sentences that aligned  wit h the targeted structures. Visual aids created through Canva added a creative dimension, allowing  pupils to contextualize their sentences within personalised themes. Advanced learners worked  independently to produce cohesive visual - text projects, while Int ermediate and Remedial learners  participated in teacher - supported activities to scaffold their learning and ensure task completion.  Active learner participation   was a key feature of the implementation.   Pupils not only  responded to prompts and created   visuals but also engaged in collaborative peer - sharing sessions.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853823  75  These sessions facilitated the exchange of ideas and feedback, enabling pupils to refine their outputs  while fostering a sense of community and mutual learning.  The evaluation and revision ph ase focused on assessing the effectiveness of PhrasePilot in  achieving its intended outcomes. Pupil outputs were evaluated for grammatical accuracy, creativity,  and contextual relevance, revealing significant improvements across all proficiency levels. Eng agement  levels were assessed through feedback, which indicated heightened interest and confidence in writing  tasks. However, the evaluation also highlighted certain challenges, particularly for Remedial learners,  who required more intensive support, and In termediate learners, who benefited from additional  practice opportunities. These findings informed proposed revisions to enhance the module, including  the introduction of further differentiated support mechanisms and expanded activities for Advanced  learne rs to challenge their proficiency.  3.   FINDINGS  3.1 The pre and post test  Table   1.   Descriptive Statistics for Pre - Test and Post - Test Scores by School  Figure 4.   Comparison of Pre and Post Test for School A and School B .  Table 1 and Figure 4   illustrate that the analysis of pre - test and post - test scores demonstrates  the efficacy of   PhrasePilot in enhancing Year 1 ESL pupils’ comprehension of the English language  structures \\\"I’ve got\\\" and \\\"I haven’t got,\\\" thereby underscoring its importance in literacy advancement.  3.1.1 Pre - Test Results  The pre - test scores for School A varied from 5   to 6, with a mean of 5.50 and a standard deviation  of 0.511. The results demonstrate minimal variability among participants, indicating a consistent  N   Minimum   Maximum   Mean   Std. Deviation  Pre Test A   24   5   6   5.50   .511  Post Test A   24   9   10   9.71   .464  Pre   Test B   24   5   10   7.05   2.200  Post Test B   24   9   10   9.79   .415\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853823  76  baseline level of language proficiency in School A. In contrast, School B\\\'s pre - test scores varied from 5  t o 10, yielding a mean score of 7.05 and a standard deviation of 2.200. The broader range and elevated  mean   scores   in   School   B   indicate   increased   variability   in   initial   language   proficiency   and   a  comparatively higher baseline relative to School A. This prel iminary evaluation offers essential insights  into the distinct requirements and linguistic abilities of the two groups, highlighting the necessity of  customised interventions to accommodate these differences.  3.1.2 Post - Test Results  The implementation of   PhrasePilot yielded substantial enhancements in post - test outcomes at  both institutions. At School A, post - test scores varied slightly from 9 to 10, with a mean of 9.71 and a  standard deviation of 0.464. The significant rise in average scores and diminishe d variability highlights  both the efficacy of the PhrasePilot app and its capacity to standardise language learning results among  students. Likewise, School B demonstrated similar post - test results, with scores ranging from 9 to 10, a  mean of 9.79, and a s tandard deviation of 0.415. The marginally elevated mean scores in School B, along  with a marginally reduced standard deviation, suggest that the application was effective for this group  of pupils.  The findings align with contemporary educational research   emphasizing the effectiveness of  interactive learning materials in improving language proficiency among young learners. Interactive  materials, such as PhrasePilot, create an immersive and engaging learning environment that supports  active participation and   sustained focus. These tools are particularly effective for early language  acquisition as they cater to the developmental needs of young learners, combining visual, auditory, and  tactile stimuli to enhance understanding and retention of linguistic structu res.  PhrasePilot leverages interactive features, such as gamified exercises and real - time feedback,  to create a dynamic learning experience. This aligns with studies highlighting the benefits of interactive  tools in making abstract language concepts more t angible and relatable for pupils (Kim et al., 2022). By  involving learners in activities that require active decision - making, the tool promotes deeper cognitive  engagement, which is critical for developing foundational language skills. Additionally, the to ol’s  structured repetition and adaptive scaffolding help reinforce the targeted language structures \\\"I’ve got\\\"  and \\\"I haven’t got,\\\" addressing gaps in conventional teaching methods that often lack individualized  support (Sharma et al., 2023).  The implement ation of PhrasePilot also facilitates autonomous learning, allowing Year 1 pupils  to practice at their own pace while receiving immediate corrective feedback. This personalized  approach not only aids in mastering language structures but also boosts pupils’   confidence in using  English. Furthermore, the tool\\\'s interactive nature fosters motivation and enjoyment, which are crucial  for sustained engagement in learning. Research by Gopalan et al. (2021) emphasizes that young learners  are more likely to achieve h igher levels of proficiency when they are engaged in enjoyable and  interactive tasks, as this minimizes the cognitive load and enhances their willingness to experiment  with new language forms.  In the context of Year 1 ESL pupils, PhrasePilot serves as an e ffective supplementary tool to  classroom instruction. The pre - test and post - test data underscore the tool\\\'s ability to bridge proficiency  gaps among pupils with varying initial language abilities. By integrating PhrasePilot into their learning  routines, ed ucators can provide a more inclusive and supportive environment that caters to the diverse  needs of their pupils. The tool’s interactive design ensures that even pupils with lower baseline  proficiency, as observed in School A, can achieve significant impro vements alongside their peers.  Thus, the use of interactive materials like PhrasePilot represents a pedagogical shift towards  more learner - centered approaches in language education. These tools not only improve linguistic\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853823  77  outcomes but also foster critical   21st - century skills, such as self - regulation and digital literacy,  preparing young learners for future educational challenges.  3.2   Observation Checklist  Table   2.

PhrasePilot, an   educational  instrument aimed at enhancing literacy skills, was deployed in two institutions (A and B) across three  observational sessions on December 16, 18, and 19. This study evaluates the efficacy of PhrasePilot in  enhancing students\\\' proficiency in spe lling and independently constructing coherent words and  phrases with confidence. The results indicate a consistent transition from instructor - led practice to  independent skill execution, demonstrating PhrasePilot\\\'s compatibility with recognised educational  theories and contemporary teaching methodologies.  The   evaluation   of   PhrasePilot\\\'s   impact   was   based   on   an   observational   checklist   that  systematically assessed five distinct literacy competencies:  1.   Spelling Words Confidently: Pupils’ ability to recall and   apply accurate spelling in written  tasks.  2.   Writing Words Independently: Constructing comprehensible words without external  assistance.  3.   Writing Simple Phrases Confidently: Formulating basic phrases, such as \\\"I\\\'ve got,\\\" with  grammatical accuracy.  4.   Writing Comp lex Phrases Confidently: Producing more intricate phrases, such as \\\"I haven’t  got,\\\" while maintaining accuracy.  5.   Writing Independently: Demonstrating complete autonomy in the construction of meaningful  written expressions.  Observations were recorded as eith er \\\"Yes\\\" or \\\"No,\\\" with accompanying notes to capture  qualitative insights into the progression of learners.  The   observations   furnish   clear   proof   of   PhrasePilot\\\'s   beneficial   influence   on   literacy  advancement. In the initial session on 16/12, students necess itated considerable assistance from their  instructors, signifying a rudimentary level of skill development. During the second session on 18/12,  significant   enhancements were noted,   as students exhibited heightened confidence and partial  autonomy. Nonethele ss, teacher assistance remained essential for specific tasks. By the concluding  session on 19/12, the majority of students exhibited complete proficiency in the evaluated criteria,  attaining the capability to independently and accurately spell and compose   phrases.  The incremental advancement noted throughout the three sessions highlights PhrasePilot\\\'s  efficacy as a systematic educational instrument. Notable progress was observed in tasks necessitating  higher - order   cognitive   abilities,   such   as   the   independen t   construction   of   intricate   phrases,  demonstrating the tool\\\'s potential to enhance advanced literacy development in a brief period.  The results correspond with socio - constructivist educational theories, especially Vygotsky’s  Zone of Proximal Development (Z PD), emphasising the significance of scaffolding in learning.  PhrasePilot implements this theoretical model by offering initial guidance and iterative practice,  facilitating learners\\\' shift from dependence on teacher support to autonomous proficiency. The   findings  align with current studies on the incorporation of technology in education. Sun, Wang, and Zhang  (2021) assert that digital tools offering prompt feedback and structured learning experiences are crucial  for improving student outcomes.  Furthermore,   the tool\\\'s ability to enhance student engagement and literacy corresponds with  the findings of Smith and Kimmons (2022), which support the incorporation of versatile digital tools to  establish   interactive   and   contextually   pertinent   learning   environments.   PhrasePilot   effectively  addresses the varied needs of learners by integrating structured repetition with opportunities for  autonomous learning.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853823  80  PhrasePilot is proof of the importance of digital tools in literacy education. Structured learning  allows a grad ual but significant transition from dependent to autonomous learning. Students\\\' writing  confidence and   independence   improved,   proving the   tool\\\'s   efficacy and   scalability in   various  educational settings. To support its literacy enhancement potential, future   studies could examine its  use in different demographic and linguistic contexts.  4.   DISCUSSION  Recent advances in educational technology, notably the incorporation of AI - powered tools  such as PhrasePilot, have changed the learning process. PhrasePilot   integrates dynamic AI - generated  graphics into lesson plans, markedly improving students\\\' capacity to associate words with concrete  objects. Research demonstrates the effectiveness of visual aids in enhancing language acquisition and  retention. Research co nducted by Lee and Lin (2019) indicates that visual aids enhance motivation in  young learners, facilitating improved comprehension and retention of new language. This corresponds  with the findings of Wang et al. (2020), who highlighted the significance of   visual aids in enhancing the  accessibility and relatability of abstract concepts for learners.  4.1 The Role of the PhrasePilot module in Enhancing English Language Learning  The PhrasePilot module illustrates this methodology, incorporating worksheets adorn ed with  vibrant graphics of lunch boxes that include vocabulary items like “banana” and “cake.” These  visualisations facilitate students\\\' linkages between words and their real - world equivalents while  enhancing engagement and motivation. Students exhibited   engaged involvement in conversations and  sentence formation activities, shifting from passive to active learners. Rahman et al. (2021) assert that  interactive and visually engaging materials are essential for fostering inclusive learning environments  that   accommodate varying competence levels.  Conventional   pedagogical   approaches   in   English   language   education   have   frequently  depended on static worksheets and oral instruction, which do not use visual aids. These strategies have  demonstrated inadequacy in enga ging learners, as the lack of meaningful context hinders students\\\'  ability to associate words with real - world items. These challenges encompass sentence formation,  characterised by frequent grammar and usage problems, resulting in diminished engagement and  excitement among learners.  4.2 The Role of the PhrasePilot module in boosting the engagement, and motivation of Year 1 pupils  In addition to boosting vocabulary recognition, the PhrasePilot - assisted method has had a  considerable impact on sentence structu re. By synchronising AI - generated pictures with structured  cues, students perceived the learning process as intuitive and less daunting. Most students were able  to create statements like \\\"I\\\'ve got a banana\\\" or \\\"I don\\\'t have pizza\\\" with few mistakes. This e nhancement  in sentence building precision highlights the revolutionary capacity of AI - driven technologies in  language teaching. Smith and Taylor\\\'s (2020) research substantiates this, emphasising that guided and  interactive techniques significantly enhance   sentence production abilities in primary school pupils.  Vocabulary recognition accuracy and sentence construction accuracy showed marked improvement  with the PhrasePilot module compared to traditional methods. Pupil engagement and confidence levels  also in creased significantly, transitioning from low to high with the introduction of the AI - assisted  module.  Beyond language achievements, the employment of visual aids and AI tools has positively  improved students\\\' attitudes towards English learning. Observatio ns indicated that the vibrant and  engaging materials diminished cognitive burden, enhancing the enjoyment of courses. Pupils exhibited\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853823  81  enthusiasm for the lessons, showcasing heightened confidence and motivation. Wang et al. (2020)  observed analogous result s, indicating that AI - augmented educational technologies diminish learning  obstacles and foster an optimal environment for learning.  Pupils expressed enthusiasm for the visually appealing content, which reduced cognitive load  and made lessons enjoyable. Ob servations confirmed that visual aids enhanced comprehension and  retention, helping pupils relate classroom concepts to real - world scenarios. The positive impact on  pupils’ attitudes toward learning English was evident throughout the study.  In summary, the   results of this study emphasise how incorporating AI and visual aids into  English language instruction has the potential to revolutionise the field. The PhrasePilot module  rectifies the deficiencies of conventional methods, promotes engagement, augments v ocabulary  recognition, and increases sentence creation precision. These findings correspond with recent studies  that emphasise the efficacy of AI - driven methodologies in basic education. The beneficial effects on  students\\\'   confidence,   motivation,   and   acade mic   performance   illustrate   the   potential   of   these  innovations in overcoming the difficulties of teaching English as a second language in varied classroom  environments.  5.   CONCLUSION  The implementation of the PhrasePilot   module across three schools with learners of varying  proficiency levels highlighted its effectiveness in enhancing English language acquisition through  innovative digital tools. By leveraging the ASSURE model, PhrasePilot addressed the unique needs of  adv anced, intermediate, and remedial learners. Advanced learners demonstrated creativity and  linguistic precision, producing detailed, grammatically accurate sentences inspired by AI - generated  visuals. Intermediate learners showed significant improvement in v ocabulary recognition and sentence  construction, transitioning from passive learning to active engagement. Remedial learners, despite  initial challenges with digital tools, gained confidence and made measurable progress through  structured scaffolding and i nteractive prompts. Overall, PhrasePilot successfully bridged gaps in  traditional teaching methods, fostering active participation, creativity, and confidence across all  proficiency levels. Its digitalized approach offers an inclusive and adaptable solutio n for enhancing  language learning. Future improvements should address digital literacy and expand scaffolding  techniques to further support diverse learner needs.

Abstract:   In rocketry, rocket fins are essential parts that guarantee stability, maximize aerodynamic performance,  and enable precise control. This study examines how the materials, forms and locations of fins affect important  performance parameters like flight time , altitude and stability of Class - I model rockets.   Delphinus, i nnovative fin  designs were created and examined using OpenRocket simulations and practical testing. These included freeform fin  shapes laser - cut from lightweight, environmentally friendly mater ials like balsa wood. The results show that the  rocket can reach altitudes of over 1,380 meters   due   to optimal fin designs, well - placed fins and lightweight materials  that greatly reduce drag and improve stability. Additionally, by highlighting sustainability through biodegradable  materials, this study highlights the commercialization possibilities of i nnovative fin designs in educational and  recreational industries. In addition to enhancing rocketry performance, these developments support environmental  objectives and encourage creativity in aerospace education and business. This effort is a first step i n creating high -  performance, reasonably priced rocketry systems that strike a balance between sustainability and technological  advancement.   By offering affordable, high - performing fin designs appropriate for educational programs, hobbyists  and aerospace en thusiasts, this research highlights the commercialization possibilities. Both performance - focused  and educational applications are supported by the designs\\\' adaptability, which gives professionals and students the  chance to experiment with cutting - edge roc ketry ideas. Additionally, the project\\\'s creative methodology encourages  the development of technical skills, creativity and critical thinking — especially in STEM education. Enhancing  national   competitiveness   in   international   markets,   encouraging   environmen tal   behaviors   and   developing  aeronautical technology are some of the wider societal effects. By bridging the gap between inventiveness and  pragmatism, this work inspires the upcoming generation of scientists and engineers and opens up new opportunities  for   rocketry development.

INTRODUCTION  Rocket fins play a critical role in the performance and stability of rockets, missiles and other  aerodynamic vehicles. Engineers grouped the components of the rocket into several systems that have  the same   functions (Rohini et al., 2022). Located at the rear of these vehicles, fins   are   part   of the  structural system which is the fuselage of an aircraft. Fins are designed to influence aerodynamic forces,  ensuring a stable and predictable trajectory. Like rudde rs on ships or feathers on arrows, fins maintain  a steady course and prevent erratic movements during flight time.  The primary function of rocket fins is stabilization. They ensure that the rocket\\\'s center of  pressure (CP) stays behind its center of gravi ty (CG), preventing tumbling and maintaining stable  flight. Fins also help with direction control, especially when in motion, allowing precise steering\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853843  85  adjustments. Additionally, fins optimize drag and lift, minimizing drag while providing the necessary  li ft to enhance stability.  Despite their importance, rocket fins face several challenges. High aerodynamic forces during  ascent, especially at transonic and supersonic speeds, can exert stress on the fins, potentially leading to  structural failure. Material   selection is crucial, as fins must withstand extreme temperatures from  aerodynamic heating while remaining lightweight to maximize payload capacity. Improper fin design  or alignment can also cause instability, leading to deviations from the intended fligh t path.  Modern engineering advancements have led to improved fin designs that address these  challenges in three key areas   namely   advanced materials, shape optimization and strategic placement.  Fins are now made from materials known for their strength and   ability to withstand extreme  conditions. Shape optimization, taking into account factors like rocket type, height and speed, further  improves performance by minimizing drag and maximizing lift. The placement of fins is also carefully  considered to maintain   stability and minimize drag.  In short , rocket fins are essential components for maintaining stability and optimizing  performance in aerodynamic vehicles. Through innovations in materials, design and placement,  modern engineering continues to improve the   effectiveness of fins, ensuring mission success and  advancing the capabilities of rocketry.  The significance of fin design in practical applications is demonstrated by several successful  rocket launches. The Space Shuttle, for instance, had big, stabilizi ng vertical fins at the back to keep  control during landing and re - entry. As the shuttle re - entered Earth\\\'s atmosphere at high speeds, the  design of these fins was essential to guaranteeing a steady and predictable trajectory. Similar to this,  SpaceX\\\'s Fal con 9 has revolutionized contemporary rocketry by emphasizing reusability. The rocket\\\'s  fins, especially the grid fins, are essential for stabilizing the craft during descent and landing. These  grid fins are made to last for several flights, demonstrating   the value of cutting - edge materials and  careful positioning in preserving the rocket\\\'s stability over time. Both instances demonstrate how  improved fin designs immediately affect mission accomplishment by guaranteeing that rockets can  return securely and d ependably in addition to reaching their destinations.  Concerning   the   problem   that   arise,   this   project   aims   to   explore   three   objectives   in  experimenting the effects of aircraft fins’ materials, shapes and placements towards the flight time,  altitude reache d and the time taken:  1.   To cut drag and guarantee steady flight, use aerodynamic principles to optimize fin shape and  alignment.  2.   To make sure fins can tolerate thermal and aerodynamic stresses by using lightweight, high - strength  materials and doing thorough   testing.  3.   To reduce fin weight without jeopardizing stability and functionality, use cutting - edge materials  and design strategies.  The remainder explains the method, findings from investigations, and the conclusion of this project.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  The   primary data collection was conducted through simulations and   real - life   experiments. The  simulations were conducted using an open software program called   O pen R ocket simulation. This\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853843  86  software allows   users   to assemble a model aircraft (commonly used in maki ng rockets). This is because  the features especially fin sets components   allow   users   to select fins from the traditional trapezoidal  and elliptical shapes, to just about any shape   that the users   can think of by using the freeform fin set  editor.   W ith the c lick of a button,   users   can transform trapezoidal and elliptical fins to freeform so that  they   can easily change the look and feel of   their   fin sets. For those who favor ring fins,   O pen R ocket  offers that option as well.   The fin types can be   mix ed   and match ed. For instance,   having trapezoidal  fins in - between ring fins. This allows users to innovate and invent new fins prototypes which is similar  to this project.  Secondly, the fabricated model rocket, Delphinus was launched on 5 September 2024 to find  out wh ether the experiment was a success or not. Delphinus have been created and developed through  the simulation software. Many improvements and upgrades were made in the software to ensure the  fabricating process will go smoothly. Hence, that is why it was giv en the name Delphinus, which  signifies a small northern constellation which   has   a distinctive   diamond - shaped   asterism, Job’s Coffin  that resembles the sharp, angular profile of a rocket’s fin. It is a prominent feature that stands out  attractively against   the celestial backdrop. The materials used were also sustainable such as cardboard,  balsa, etc. In order to get an accurate result, all of the measurements and cutting process were done  using the laser cutting method for the fins. This is to ensure no huma n errors will affect the findings of  this project.  3. FINDINGS  T he simulations and real - world tests   are further explained in this section.   The first findings on  the earlier phase of the model assembling. Figure 1 shows the graph of the highest apogee,   lateral  distance, maximum velocity and acceleration of the rocket, and the time taken by the Class - I rocket.  This simulation aims to assess the capabilities of a set of innovative rocket fins assembled with a Class -  I rocket. Analyzing the stability, weight   and altitudes attained is the aim. Similar research will be  compared and the results will be critically discussed.  Figure 1 .   OpenRocket Simulation Graph .  3.1   Altitudes Attained  Firstly, the altitudes that can be attained depend significantly on the fin’ s shape. This is because  the shape designs will influence the drag coefficient and the stability of the rocket. The study by Pektaş  et al. (2019) looks into the effects of various fin designs on the apogee and stability of rockets. It\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853843  87  investigates whether   and how the fin designs examined in the research could improve or stabilize the  Class - I motor rocket\\\'s 1000m altitudes.  Second ly ,   Delphinus’   fin freeform design was specifically made and laser cut to avoid any  errors. The most common rocket fin’s design is elliptical - shaped due to its rounded tip that can  minimize drag on the rocket. Despite that,   Delphinus’   freeform fin is a combination of a   clipped  parallelogram - shaped fin and a tapered swept - shaped fin.   Delphinus   provided a huge contribution  towards the altitudes that could be attained with the Class - I model rocket which is 1384m.  3.2   Weight of   F ins  First, the weight of fins can be altered b y using different types of materials. The weight,  strength, and durability of the fin materials must be taken into account during the   design   process. This  is because the weight of the rocket will influence the   aerodynamics’   efficiency, mainly the drag  coef ficient. The lower the amount of drag, the higher the altitude that will be obtained.  N ext,   Figure 2 shows the balsa wood used in   this high - powered model rocket for the fins  weighing only around 0.0493 kg.   This material is quite common in building small   rocket models.  However, using less than 2 kg is considered very rare and sometimes even impossible to obtain .   Other  lightweight materials that can be substituted   include   basswood or plywood which is   harder and less  fragile than balsa.  Figure 2.   Balsa Woo d.  In short, the selection of lightweight materials is very crucial due to its effects   on   the apogee  and the trajectory direction.  3. 3   Stability of Rocket  Figure 3 and Figure 4 shows   Delphinus on the body of Rocket Model   and real - world test ,  respectively .   T he most ideal number of fins is three to four fins. Each fin added to the number of fins  will influence the position of the   CP   to further back, ensuring a more stable rocket. The position of the  CP   must be behind the   CG   which lies in the middle of the rocket’s components.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853843  88  Figure   3.   Delphinus on Rocket Model .  F igure 4.   Real - World Test .  Next, the stability of the rocket is greatly influenced by the placement of the fins. This is because  it plays a pivotal role   in   influencing the   CP . A strategic fins placement is by moving it as far back on  the body tube as possible. Excellent flight stability can also be achieved by 1 caliber. 2 or 3 calibers of  stability means that the aircraft will have a greater tendency to wea thercock into the wind.  Lastly, the rocket model can be categorized as a stable rocket due to its four fins and the stability  which is 1.9 cal. The stability that was primarily preserved by this rocket was a result of well - placed  fins and an ideal   CG   to   CP   ratio (Kelly, 2019). The rocket produced comparable results with a   CG/CP  ratio of two body diameters, enabling stable ascent (Kelly, 2019).\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853843  89  4. DISCUSSION  The rocketry field has been evolving remarkably over the years with improvements in  materials and a   variety of newly invented shape designs gradually improving rocket performance. One  of the developments includes a balsa - made fin combined with innovative fin forms like this study’s  rocket.   This   novelty   can   make   a   notable   enhancement   to   industrial   perfor mances   and  commercialization which will bring a myriad of advantages to all people of all skill levels.  This type of novelty brings loads of golden opportunities for the industry to upgrade their  projects’ components. In particular, this project’s novelty allows the model to reach higher altitudes  than targeted and maximum speeds by optimizing their aircraft ’s fin shapes to reduce drag and higher  stability.   Delphinus ’   exact design and the lightweight nature of balsa help to significantly lower  aerodynamic resistance besides maintaining the structural integrity of the model .   By immersing in this  idea, both ama teurs and experts can achieve new performance levels ,   manufacturing sophistication and  also create many outstanding opportunities .  Next,   Delphinus   is   a   potential   product   for   commercialization,   offering   new   business  opportunities for both educational market s and hobbyists. A unique selling proposition can be created  by converting creative fin shapes into model rocket kits, which can be both for performance - oriented  or educational purposes.   By emphasizing the aerodynamic benefits of balsa fins, manufacturers   can  draw in both educators and enthusiasts looking for a high - performing yet reasonably priced rocketry  experience at the same time .  On the other hand, as environmental concerns become increasingly important, the use of  biodegradable things like balsa offe rs a unique branding opportunity and contributes to the   Sustainable  Development Goals (SDG)   at the same time. In this way, many companies can attract a lot of eco -  conscious   customers   by   highlighting   the   sustainability   of   the   balsa   fins .   Both   hobbyists   and  professionals that is looking for   environmentally   friendly solutions for their rocketry endeavors may  find resonance in this branding.  C ollaborations with educational institutes would guarantee a steady demand for advanced  customized balsa fins. Providing top - notch customized rocketries to universities,   STEM   programs and  secondary schools allows business   endeavors   to establish a long - term   connection and brand awareness  in the academic sector. In general, this situation will strengthen the process of developing an open -  minded future generation of scientists and engineers.  5. CONCLUSION  In conclusion,   Delphinus   achieved its performance objec tives, demonstrating steady flight and  control. The completed product brings a novelty in the rocketry field. This study offers individuals to  foster their own creativity apart from providing a competitive edge and also to ensure safety. Thus, this  study c ontributes to personal growth and advancement in the field of rocketry. Furthermore, new  innovations can have a good impact on the educational field, especially in Aerofields. This study  permits them to stimulate critical thinking and sharpen their creativ ity, enhance technical skills and  also encourage them to immerse themselves in these fields providing them with valuable, practical  knowledge that is essential in future engineering and scientific careers. Besides that, fin design  innovations   can   have   broa d   and   significant   impacts   on   society   in   numerous   ways   including  encouraging economic and technological growth and also reducing environmental impacts at the same  time. New inventions and innovations, especially in rocketry can also widen a nation’s militar y and\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14853843  90  defense capabilities. Plus, it also contributes to a nation’s technological prowess and competitiveness  in global aerospace markets. In short, this study provides a thorough exposure to the public in hopes  of it being disseminated more widely to othe rs.

Abstract:   This study investigates the integration of water level monitoring   in reservoir tanks to improve water  management, mitigate risks, and enhance safety within plant control systems. A semi - automated control system,  utilizing Arduino microcontrollers and ultrasonic sensors, was designed to maintain accurate water levels whil e  reducing operational inefficiencies and hazards. Experimental results revealed that the semi - automated approach  significantly reduced the time required for tank filling and draining from 5 and 6 minutes, respectively, to just 1  minute and 38 seconds each . This advancement eliminated risks associated with manual handling, such as wet floors  and slipping hazards, and promoted a safer working environment. Furthermore, the system minimized water waste  and enhanced resource conservation, contributing to sustai nable laboratory practices. The proposed system  demonstrates considerable potential for application in industrial and educational settings, where it not only enhances  operational efficiency but also fosters a culture of safety and environmental responsibil ity. These findings emphasize  the importance of integrating innovative control systems to address contemporary challenges in water management  and plant operations.

INTRODUCTION  Water waste is a significant threat to the environment   in laboratory operations because several  processes, such as washing glassware, cooling equipment, and chemical reactions, require considerable  water. Uncontrolled water use raises operating expenses, depletes resources, and, if improperly  disposed of, can   harm the environment. For example, excessive rinse methods or continuous - flow  systems might consume significantly more water than   is necessary,   and   improper   wastewater  treatment can discharge pollutants into the environment. Reducing laboratory water wast e and the  environmental impact of scientific research can be achieved by putting into practice effective water  management techniques.  Water   management   in   the lab   is vital for   operational effectiveness and   environmental  sustainability. For cooling, rinsing , and diluting, laboratories frequently need enormous volumes of  water. If this isn\\\'t closely monitored, it can lead to excessive waste and expensive utility expenses.  Effective water management minimizes the risk of pollutant discharge into ecosystems and   conserves\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14854347  92  this essential resource, which lessens the environmental impact of scientific activities. Additionally,  encouraging researchers to use only what is necessary, it fosters a culture of responsible science.  Furthermore, adopting sustainable practic es — like recirculating cooling systems, low - flow fixtures, and  water recycling when practical — helps a lab lower its carbon footprint and match its operations with  more general sustainability objectives, which is advantageous for the environment and the inst itution.  In laboratory settings, the water level control experiment provides beneficial hands - on learning  opportunities that link the theoretical and practical components of control systems. Through practical  water level manipulation in a controlled tank   setting, students learn important ideas in process  dynamics, feedback control, and disturbance rejection. This experience is essential for students  studying mechanical and plant control, where they must learn how to calibrate equipment, adjust  parameters,   and watch how systems react to changes in real - time.   While handling variations in water  levels brought on by outside influences, students can improve their skills in reaction time analysis,  proportional - integral - derivative   (PID)   controller   adjustment,   and   troubleshooting   by   simulating  disturbances like oscillatory loads or step shifts   ( Urrea   & Páez, 2021 ). Research indicates that these trials  enhance students\\\' comprehension of process modeling   and system stability, which are critical abilities  for both academic and industrial settings .  Experiments with water level control are useful for comprehending process dynamics, but if  water use is not controlled properly, they may cause environmental p roblems. Significant water waste  can happen in open - loop systems without water recycling, especially in big labs that run continuously.  Particularly in areas where water resources are scarce, this usage adds to resource depletion and puts  further demand on   them. Furthermore, incorrect experimental water disposal might result in pollution  and negative environmental effects, particularly if the water is combined with chemicals .  By highlighting the effective use of water, laboratory water level control studi es support  sustainable resource management. Closed - loop systems, which reduce water waste and promote  recycling, are used in many experiments. This enables students to learn resource conservation while  studying control systems ( Iskandar, et al ., 2019 ).   In   industrial settings where water conservation is  essential, this approach supports more general sustainability objectives. In addition to teaching  feedback management and disturbance rejection, these lab tasks inspire aspiring engineer ing   teams   to  use envir onmentally friendly practices in their work.  During a recent water level control lab exercise, there was an event when water splashed onto  the floor as the tank was being filled and drained. Water splashed throughout the setup area as a result  of a tiny l eak caused by a misaligned hose connection when water was poured into the tank. High water  flow rates throughout the drainage process resulted in splashing close to the drain, which made the  floor slick. Although there were no injuries, the event made clea r the necessity of more stringent water -  handling procedures since wet floors raise the risk of slips and falls (National Safety Council [NSC],  2021). According to research, mitigating these incidents in laboratory settings entails managing water  flow rates   during drainage and routinely inspecting and tightening hose connections (American  Chemical Society [ACS], 2020). By taking these precautions, someone can keep the environment at work  safer and avoid any potential risks from water spills.  Significant asp ects of risk assessment in occupational safety and health (OSH) are highlighted  by the recent incident involving water spilling on the lab floor during the tank filling and drainage  stages. Finding possible risks, such as wet and slick floors, which greatl y raise the possibility of trips,  falls, and slides, requires risk assessment (National Safety Council [NSC], 2021). Risk assessment in  OSH entails determining the seriousness of potential outcomes as well as the probability that incidents  will occur. Give n the serious consequences of a slip or fall injury and the possibility of water leaks from  misaligned hoses and excessive drainage flow rates, risk reduction measures are necessary in this\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14854347  93  situation. Pre - use assessments to make sure hose connections are t ight, instruction on regulated water  flow during drainage, and the installation of anti - slip mats to prevent falls are all examples of effective  risk reduction. The OSH guidelines, which prioritize hazard identification, risk assessment, and the  applicatio n of workable solutions to establish safer laboratory environments, are in line with these risk  control methods (American Chemical Society [ACS], 2020).  The Hierarchy of Controls in Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) provides an organized  method for put ting risk - reduction strategies into practice in order to lessen the possibility of water  splashing and related risks. Elimination is the first step in the hierarchy; ideally, water -   handling  procedures should be changed to completely avoid spills, for exam ple, by using automated filling  systems that do away with the need for manual adjustments.   DOSH Malaysia\\\'s 2018 Guidelines for  Manual Handling at Workplace place a strong emphasis on the necessity of removing risks related to  manual handling duties, especi ally those brought on by ergonomic concerns. In order to protect  employees\\\' health and safety, the rules urge companies to be proactive in detecting and reducing  hazards.  Waluś, Warguła,   Wieczorek   & Krawiec   (2022)   study   offers valuable insights into the s lip  resistance of various flooring materials in public utility buildings, the wet floor issue remains a  significant gap. Since the risk of slipping increases dramatically on wet surfaces, future studies should  incorporate tests under both wet and dry condi tions to ensure a more accurate understanding of slip  resistance.   Using more stable or splash - resistant equipment made to reduce water spills could be a  substitute if elimination is not practical. Engineering controls are also useful; for instance, putting   up  barriers or splash guards around drainage and filling areas can assist keep water contained and keep it  from getting to the floor. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for firmly fastening hoses and utilizing  slower flow rates during draining are examp les of administrative controls. The final line of defense  against slip hazards for lab workers is personal protective equipment (PPE), such as footwear that is  resistant to slips (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH], 2021). Each c ontrol  layer successfully lowers the overall risk of water - related incidents, making the lab environment much  safer when this hierarchy is followed.  The Plant Control Systems course will be introduced to final - semester Mechanical Engineering  (Plant) diplo ma students. The control system process, which typically uses water as a fluid medium, is  part of several hands - on activities in this course. The observation indicates that the practice of merely  disposing of the water used for practical tasks has been ing rained in this laboratory. A substantial  amount of wastewater spilled onto the lab floor as a result of the simultaneous processes of filling the  tank with water and draining it. There are other concerns in this scenario than water management,  which is the   possibility of physical hazards when this practical task is implemented. This indicates that  addressing the risk of physical hazards and practicing wise water management will be the main goals  of this study. As a result, a water reservoir control system w ill be designed to address safety issues and  water management concerns.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  Akinwole   (2020)   study offers a creative and useful approach to water management by  thoroughly examining the use of an Arduino microcontroller to automatically   regulate tank water  levels. The method successfully combines software (algorithm - based coding and simulation using  Proteus) and hardware (Arduino and LCD), exhibiting a methodical design and implementation  process.   Also,   Wahyuni,   Sentana,   Muhardi & Irawan,   ( 2021)   emphasises the significance of water  management and details the creation of a system that uses an Arduino Uno and ultrasonic sensors to  monitor and regulate water levels. This strategy is admirable for resolving issues with conventional\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14854347  94  level - switc h systems, like frequent pump activation brought on by buoy failures. Utilising cutting - edge  technology, like the LM016L LCD and the HC - SR04 ultrasonic sensor, shows creativity and usefulness  and makes the solution appropriate for a range of uses.  Student s can demonstrate the fundamental control theories and concepts of industrial process  control systems using the Process Control Trainer Model SE202. The unit is a simplified process model  of a typical industrial process that includes batch process control,   temperature, and flow. The sump  tank needs to be filled with water before this experiment begins. After that, the water can be heated by  pumping it around the process rig.   The level controller will receive a measurement from a level  transmitter that detec ts the level control tank within. To modify the incoming flow rate to the level  control tank, the controller will control the pump speed. Figure 1 shows the unit assembly for the  Process Control Trainer. The technique for putting in and removing water from   the sump tank is one  issue   associated   with   the study\\\'s   focus.   Once the sump   tank is filled   and   emptied,   water   is  simultaneously spilling onto the floor. The physical hazard results from this.  Figure 1.   Unit assembly for Process Control Trainer Model SE202.  To ensure continuous operation, the reservoir tank\\\'s water level management system must  keep the water level constant within a predetermined range. To avoid overflow or depletion, the system  should b e able to detect and modify water levels with minimal error, keeping an accuracy of ±1 cm. It  must react to changes in water supply or usage quickly — less than five seconds — to modify the water  input or outflow as necessary. The system should be able to hand le peak inflows without affecting  stability and sustain a wide variety of flow rates to meet different operating situations.  It must also deal with access to water, humidity, and temperature changes, making it resilient  and dependable in possibly hazardou s conditions. To ensure safe operation and avoid equipment  damage, safety features such as automatic fault detection, emergency shutoff, and overflow and low -  level alerts are crucial. Additionally, the system should be easy to use, with a clear interface f or real -  time water level and system status monitoring.  To maintain the appropriate water level in a reservoir tank, the water level control system  makes use of an Arduino microcontroller, an on/off controller, a pump, and an ultrasonic sensor.  Zakamaldin,   &   Andyk   (2014)   developed   straightforward applications, an autonomous liquid level\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14854347  95  control system with a two - position controller and self - regulation is a suitable solution; nevertheless, its  stability and performance rely significantly on the controller\\\'s   adjustment and a   thorough analysis of  the system dynamics. As seen in Figure 2,   the   overall system can be made simpler with a block diagram.  Positioned at the top of the tank, the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between itself and the  water\\\'s surfa ce and instantly converts that measurement into the water level.  Figure 2.   Block Diagram for Water Level in the Reservoir Control System.  The Arduino, the central control unit, receives this data from the sensor. The Arduino controls  the on/off   controller to regulate the pump based on set - up high and low water level limits. The Arduino  starts the pump to fill the tank when the water level falls below the lowest threshold and stops it when  the water level reaches the upper threshold. This straight forward on/off control method works well for  keeping water within the appropriate range and provides an affordable, easy - to - use solution that  makes use of the Arduino\\\'s programming capabilities for simple calibration and control modifications.  3.   FINDINGS  Figure 3 displays a reservoir tank that is intended to be the main source of water for a sump  tank in a water delivery system. Adjacent to the reservoir is an on/off control device that enables  accurate water flow regulation. Maintaining an effec tive and long - lasting water level control system is  the objective of this configuration. With the reservoir tank serving as the primary supply source, the  design may be able to solve issues with water delivery and ensure a steady flow to the sump tank as  r equired. Putting this setup into practice might help find a workable solution for the problems this  study covers .  Figure   3 .   CAD drawing for the reservoir tank .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14854347  96  The reservoir tank is seen in actual use in figure 4(a). A pump that provides water to the sump  tank is included in this tank. The controller features two buttons on top that are used to transmit a  command to the pump to fill the sump tank and return the w ater to the reservoir tank. Figure 4(b)  illustrates this. To measure the current height of the water level in both tanks, an ultrasonic sensor is  affixed to the top of the tank and serves as a detector. The pump will cease supplying water once the  specifie d level is reached.  Figure4(a).   Figure 4(b).  Table   1   distinguishes manual   and   semi - automated   approaches   to reservoir   filling   and  emptying. Using the manual method, as seen in figure 5(a), filling and draining take five and six  minutes, respectively. As seen in figure 6(a), hazards include a wet floor   and a significant likelihood of  slipping due to the repetitive task. The semi - automatic approach, on the other hand, significantly  reduces filling and draining durations to 1 minute and 38 seconds each, eliminates wet floor hazards,  reduces slip hazards,   and eliminates repetitive tasks, all of which   enhance   overall ergonomics. Figure  5(b) and figure 6(b) demonstrate this. The project has resulted in a safer and more effective solution by  effectively addressing and resolving the main problems.  Table 1.

Water spillage and slipping   hazards are  successfully reduced, filling and draining periods are shortened, and water waste is avoided by putting  in place a semi - automated control system. Ultrasonic sensors and an Arduino - based controller work  together to enable accurate water level co ntrol, which saves resources and improves lab safety in  general. This system is a useful tool for both industrial and educational applications since it not only  effectively addresses real - world problems that arise in lab settings but also encourages sustai nable  water use and strengthens a safety culture.

Abstract:   The Radiographic Image   Analysis   module is designed to cover the fundamental concepts and skills needed  to evaluate radiographic images for diagnostic purposes. The COVID - 19 pandemic has disrupted traditional  classroom learning, forcing lecturers to adjust the curriculum to the remote fo rmat, besides ensuring students stay  motivated and engaged. The teaching was designed using Miro, which allows users to collaborate in real time. A  concept map was chosen to present each radiographic image from a specific body part and easily organize it i nto  categories. Radiographic images were imported to the board, and the tools provided by Miro were used to add text  and other elements. Students were grouped with the assigned activities. Assigned tasks have to be completed within  the timeframe. Any commu nication during the session was using the chat box. Miro emphasizes active learning,  where students are actively engaged in the learning process. It captures students’ attention quickly and efficiently,  making them more likely to be motivated.

INTRODUCTION  The Radiographic Image   Analysis   module is designed to equip students with essential concepts  and skills for evaluating radiographic images used in diagnostic procedures. The COVID - 19 pandemic  necessitated a shift from traditional classroom learning to remote education, prompting educato rs to  innovate curriculum delivery   (Koh & Daniel, 2022) .  This manuscript discusses   implementing   an interactive learning approach using Miro, a  collaborative online platform, to enhance student engagement and motivation in the learning process.  The COVID - 1 9 pandemic disrupted conventional educational methodologies, compelling educators to  adapt their teaching strategies.  In   radiography, where practical skills and image analysis are paramount, maintaining student  engagement in a remote setting poses signifi cant challenges. Thus, the Radiographic Image Evaluation  module was   restructured to facilitate active learning through Miro,   allowing real - time student  collaboration .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861453  100  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  2.1 Platform Utilization  Miro was selected for its interactive fea tures, which support collaborative learning. The  platform enables users to create visual concept maps that organize radiographic images from various  body parts into distinct categories. This visual organization aids in   comprehending and retaining  knowledge regarding image evaluation.  2.2 Image Analysis Framework  Radiographic images were systematically imported into Miro (Figure 1), where students could  interact with the content (Figure 2). The module emphasized the following key components   (Table   1).  Table 1 .   Key components .  Component   Descriptions  Image Quality Assessment   Students   learned   to   identify   factors   affecting  image quality, including exposure settings and  positioning.  Corrective Actions   The module provided guidelines on how to take  corrective   actions   to   improve   image   quality,  ensuring optimal diagnostic outcomes.  Collaborative Tasks   Students were grouped and assigned specific  activities, which they had to complete within  designated timeframes. This structure fostered  teamwork and   accountability.  Communication Tools   Throughout the sessions, students utilized the  chat box for communication, facilitating  discussions and clarifications in   real time .  Figure 1 .   Radiographic images were imported into Miro.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861453  101  Figure   2 .   Students\\\'   interaction with the content on the Miro board.  3. FINDINGS  Interactive online learning represents a significant shift from traditional teacher - centered  approaches to   learner - centred ones . This transformation emphasizes active engagement, allowing  students to take charge of their educational journeys.   Interactive online learning captures students\\\'  attention   through   engaging   content   that   stimulates   multiple   senses.   Unlike   passive   learning  environments where students may listen or read, interactive pl atforms incorporate videos, animations,  simulations, and gamified elements that encourage participation. This multi - modal engagement not  only makes learning enjoyable but also helps in retaining information more effectively .  The flexibility of interactive   online learning accommodates various learning preferences —  visual, auditory, and kinesthetic — by integrating different teaching methods into a single lesson. This  adaptability ensures that all students can engage with the material in a way that resonates wit h them  personally, enhancing motivation and investment in their education .  When students are actively involved in their learning process, they tend to be more motivated.  The fun and collaborative nature of interactive learning creates an environment where   students feel  empowered to explore and express their ideas freely. This motivation is crucial for sustaining interest  over time, particularly in subjects that may otherwise seem challenging or dull .  Interactive online platforms facilitate   peer collaboratio n   through discussion boards, group  projects, and virtual meetings. This sense of community not only enhances social skills but also allows  students to learn from one another\\\'s perspectives and experiences. As they work together on tasks, they  develop teamw ork skills essential for future professional environments.  One of the key advantages of interactive learning is the provision of real - time feedback.   This  immediate response fosters a more dynamic learning environment where adjustments can be made   on  the fl y , enhancing the overall educational experience .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861453  102  4. DISCUSSION  4.1 Novelty and Uniqueness  The interactive nature of Miro significantly enhanced student engagement (Ali , Narayan &  Sharma , 2020). Feedback indicated that students found the platform\\\'s collab orative features beneficial  for learning. The concept map allowed for a clear visual representation of the relationships between  different radiographic images and their diagnostic implications.  5.1 Benefits to Mankind  The shift to an interactive learning e nvironment using Miro has demonstrated the potential to  maintain student motivation during remote learning. Active learning strategies, such as collaborative  tasks and real - time communication, have   improved   knowledge retention and application in practical  scenarios.  5. CONCLUSION  Implementing   the Radiographic   Image   Analysis   module   through   Miro   emphasizes   the  importance of active learning in radiography education. By fostering an engaging and collaborative  online environment, students are more likely to remain motivated and effectively acquire the necessary  skills for radiogr aphic image analysis. This approach   addresses the challenges posed by the COVID - 19  pandemic and   sets a precedent for future educational methodologies in radiography.

Abstract:   In this digital era, students face various challenges in adapting to modern learning methods, especially  new   students who often experience difficulties such as a lack of relevant reference materials, difficulty adapting to  new learning approaches, and the burden of the cost of purchasing physical textbooks. Digital technology has  emerged as a solution to this iss ue, with the use of Smart   Xcess@BCW   becoming one of the increasingly popular  approaches in improving learning effectiveness. Smart   Xcess@BCW   offer the advantage of providing interactive,  dynamic, and easily accessible content that can adapt to the needs of   a new generation of students who are more  inclined to technology. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of   digital learning   Smart   Xcess@BCW  in the   Building Construction Workshop course   compared to three similar courses   using conventiona l method  (Brickwork & Concrete Workshop, Plumbing & Carpentry Workshop, IBS Workshop) . This study involves a  quantitative approach through analysis of final exam results to see the impact of using Smart   Xcess@BCW   on  students\\\' understanding, academic achiev ement, and their motivation. The findings of the study show that the use  of Smart   Xcess@BCW   significantly increases students\\\' understanding of the concepts taught, strengthens self -  learning, and has a positive impact on academic achievement .   The data reveals that Smart Xcess@BCW supported  learning in the Building Construction Workshop outperforms the traditional methods, particularly in producing a  higher proportion of top - performing students (\\\'A\\\' grades).   In addition, the use of Smart   Xcess@B CW   also  successfully increases student motivation by increasing focus and enthusiasm in learning. Overall, this study  suggests that the integration of Smart   Xcess@BCW   as a learning tool can enrich   educational   experience and provide  guidance to higher educa tion institutions in adapting a more effective digital learning approach for today\\\'s  generation of students.

INTRODUCTION  Smart Xcess@BCW   is a production of innovation in the form of interactive learning in practical  T&L developed for the Building Construction Workshop course. The development of this innovation  has been made in the English version to meet the needs of the curriculum in lear ning and teaching at  the Polytechnic. The production of Smart Xcess@BCW aims to facilitate the teaching and learning  process in practical work while increasing student interest. The development of this interactive learning  innovation is also in line with t he development of technology in today\\\'s education which requires more  creative, innovative and interactive teaching techniques   (Surachman et al., 2024) . The use of interactive  materials can make learning easier and more interesting   (Omar, 2022) .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861474  104  Figure 1 .   Smart Xcess@BCW front view  1. 1   Purpose  Issues and challenges in understanding civil engineering practical procedures among students  are an important topic in the context of TVET education in higher education institutions. Learning  practical p rocedures involves an understanding of techniques, technology, and safety related to the  field of civil engineering   (Ealangov, 2023) . However, there are several main challenges that prevent  students from gaining a deep understanding, among them the problem   of lack of practical exposure,  weakness in theoretical knowledge, lack of suitable facilities, time constraints, and the attitude and  motivation of the students themselves   ( Bahtiar et al., 2020 ) . The objective of this innovation are as  follows:  a.   Provid e learning resources that can be accessed digitally anytime and anywhere to facilitate  students acquisition of knowledge about civil engineering practice without the constraints of  location and time.  b.   Help students understand and master the steps and pra ctical engineering procedures through  clear explanations and the use of multimedia elements such as videos and interactive  simulations.  c.   Foster active learning by providing interactive activities and quiz questions that can stimulate  critical   thinking   an d   enhance   collaboration   between   students   and   instructors   through  technology - based features.  d.   Applying the use of modern technology in the practical learning process is in line with the  needs of an increasingly digital and high - tech industry.  e.

INTRODUCTION  Malaysia, characterized by its tropical climate is prone to frequently droughts that disrupt  municipal water supplies, leaving communities without access to clean and potable   water. This issue  is further compounded by rapid urbanization and climate change, which intensify the demand for  existing water resources   (Lani et al., 2018) .   Rainwater   h arvesting   system   (RWH)   had been practically  used   in the world to cope with water supply needs   (Campisano et al., 2017) .   Although   RWH   have been  adopted in some areas   in Malaysia,   but these are often restricted to non - potable uses such as irrigation,  failing to meet the urgent need for safe drinking water   during emergencies.   Despite with the climate  challenges, Malaysia shall utilize the high rainfall   distribution   with the average   1800 - 3500 mm in  Peninsular Malaysia, 2500 - 4000 mm in Sarawak while 1500   –   3000 mm in Sabah   (MET, n,d) . Based on  this general ra infall distribution, a study on this proposal particularly constructed to find on the better  solution of potable water distribution in Malaysia.   Malaysia is blessed with   high annual rainfall , hence  RWH installation   beneficially   save the usage of treated water   (Shaari, 2020) .\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861493  116  This project introduces a solar - powered rainwater harvesting system, aiming to provide  potable water during drought   or   municipal water disruptions.   Both critical   situations   are concern as an  emergency which   cause daily routine interruption s   in residential areas, especially in areas that  frequently experience clean water access problems .   The system integrates the advanced Australi a n  rainwater   harvesting   technologies and renewable solar energy for power, ensuring sustainability and  reliability   (Chubaka et al., 2018) . By incorporating smart technologies including zoning system and  smart metering or real time monitoring, the project emphasizes fair distribu tion and promoting  sustainable practices. Moreover, the system meets both emergency needs and long   - term water  management in Malaysia’s residential communities during the critical situations.  The proposed system is aligned with Environmental, Social and G overnance (ESG) principles  making this as a holistic solution for sustainable water development   (Radzi et al., 2023) . From the aspect  of environmental, this system will decrease the dependency on fossil fuel and municipal water supplies  which encourage   water reservation and mitigate urban flooding challenges.   According to   Siphambe et  al. (2024),   flood in a city can be avoided   by systematically harvesting, storing rainwater, and using it  for multiple purpose .   In term of s ocial, it ensures equitable access   of potable water such as drinking  water,   particularly   during   emergencies,   enhancing   community   resilience.   From   a   governance  perspective,   this system can   be   implemented   through collaborative partnerships between government  agencies, private developers, and   local communities   in order to meet and supports Malaysia’s climate  goals .   There is a need for practitioners and policymakers to   involve   in   investments   of   drinking water  systems to support associated economic, security, and public health benefits   (Lebu et   al., 2024).  Integrating ESG principles strengthens the system’s   while   positioning it as a forward - thinking  innovation for sustainable water management.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  2.1   Rainwater Collection  Rainwater   collection start   from rooftop catchment areas and   channelled   through corrosion -  resistant gutters into high - capacity storage tanks.   The utilization of a   first - flush diverter   aiming   to  eliminate the   initial runoff containing debris and contaminants,   purposely to ensure   clean er water  enters the system.   To guarantee the durability and safety for potable use, the   storage tanks   will be  constructed   from   food - grade polyethylene.   O verflow mechanisms   and   level   sensors   will   be   a  significant integration to ensure the   effective water ma nagement.  2.2   Filtration and Disinfection  The collected rainwater will   flow   through a multi - stage filtration system   which include the  sediment filters   as it functions to   remove   unwanted   matter s   and activated carbon filters to eliminate  odors , chemicals, and impurities.   Adoption of   UV sterilization units   works   to disinfect the water,  ensuring it meets   the compliances of   potable standards   which safe   for drinking and cooking. This  combination guarantees   the safety of   water quality   for the househ old usage and avoid any causes of  negative impact on communities.  2.3   Solar Power Integration  The system   approach is   to generate renewable energy for powering pumps, filtration systems,  and UV sterilizers   through utilization of   photovoltaic (PV) panels .   Us e of l ithium - ion battery storage  will   become as alternative   power   during nighttime   or   overcast conditions   to avoid   operation\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861493  117  interruption . The   incorporation   of solar energy   will decrease the   dependency on grid electricity,  bolstering   the system’s sustainability and resilience during   critical situations.  2.4   Zoning for Water Distribution  Each division of residential area will be   equipped with   flow meter   and automated valves to  manage water distribution.   Strategic zoning system purposel y to ensure equitable allocation of water  distribution among communities, depends on the   population density and demand, while surplus water  from one zone can be   channelled immediately   to another to   maximize   resource utilization. This  approach   guarantees   fa ir and efficient distribution of resources   in time of crisis .  2.5   Controlled Usage and Automation  The installation of smart meter is   needed   to monitor household water consumption, enforcing  quota - based allocations   based on priority   uses   during emergencies.   Sensors will monitor municipal  water supply levels and tank capacities,   alarming   the system automatically during   water   disruptions  happen .   To smooth the monitoring from authorize party, a   centralized dashboard will provide real -  time data on water usage and system performance . Form the centralized dashboard monitoring, it will  enable the   management efficiency   and   immediate   troubleshooting when needed.  Figure 1 .

Illustration of the   p roposed Solar - Powered Rainwater Harvesting System  3. FINDINGS  3.1 .   Community Perception  Based on observations, it appears that c ommunit ies   who   has trouble   during water disruptions,  would   agree   to   support the implementation of a potable rainwater harvesting system.   From the  discussion with   communities of a residential area, they   highlight a   critical   need for reliable potable  water sources during droughts   for   their daily usage .   Most of the residents   acknowledged the long - term  benefits of   the ability of this advance system which could   provide clean water during emergencies,  despite some concerns about   overall system installation cost .   The positive feedback from   some of   the  residents , demonstrate high level of   interest   and   willingness to adopt innovative water solutions.  3.2.   Infrastructure Readiness  The system centralization which   focusing on wide - area rainwater harvesting rather than  individual   a single unit i nstallation each house .   From the   assessments   of i nfrastructure , it   reveals   that  public facilities, open spaces, and other centralized locations are suitable for rainwater collection and  storage.   From another observation , the   current   distribution network may require   modification   or  extensions to   ensure the flow of   treated water   channelled efficiently   from the central system to  residential areas. This   demonstrates   the   important of   strategic planning to   employ   the system into  existing u rban and rural infrastructures.  3.3.   Challenges Identified  Few   challenges have been identified   in the effort to implement   centralized system.   Lack of  public awareness   among   Malaysian especially   about the   benefits   of centralized potable rainwater  harvestin g remains a   major obstacle .   Those whom never experience water disruption difficulty will  concern on other beneficial project investment instead of spending cost for this system.   Additionally,  retrofitting or   constructing   new distribution pipelines to conne ct the centralized system to homes  presents logistical and financial challenges. Another critical challenge is   the scarcity of land available\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861493  119  for the installation   of   rainwater storage tanks, filtration units, and solar arrays, particularly in   high  populated urban areas.   Hence, the   importance of stakeholder collaboration and government incentives  to facilitate implementation   is needed to ensure Malaysia water security well concern.   Due to the  current increased interest in   ESG and   sustainability issu es brought on by climate change, investors are  more interested in developing sustainable investments   ( Radzi et al., 2023) .  4. DISCUSSION  This project proposal of   solar - powered rainwater harvesting system   offers   an innovative  solution to Malaysia’s water security   issues . By integrating renewable energy and advanced filtration  technologies, the system   could solve the issue of potable water supply   during emergencies. The  approach of   zoning system   addresses the   effi ciency by distributing water   fairly   across residential areas,  while automation reduces manual intervention and improves operational reliability.   Table 1 shows the  difference between this proposed system and other   rain water   harvesting   systems.  Table 1 .

Challenges  One of the significant challenges faced by the project is   the financially due to   the high initial  installation cost. Advanced technologies such as solar panels, multi - stage filtration systems, and  automation mechanisms   are costly , which may deter adoption among residents   even though they  aware the benefit of the system . However, this c hallenge can be   solved if this project receives   financial  support   from   government   subsidies,   partnerships   with   private   developers,   and   streamlined  manufacturing processes for key components.   Furthermore ,   the importance of   educating potential  users about th e long - term cost savings and benefits of the system can   help   to address concerns about  affordability, fostering wider acceptance and implementation.  4.2 .   Opportunities  Despite these challenges, the   positive side of the proposed   system presents substantial  opportunities. The centralized approach   enables   for scalability   which could make it   adaptable for urban  residential developments, rural communities, and even public facilities like schools and hospitals. By  utilizing   Malaysia’s abundant rainfall and solar energy,   government can look forward on   the system  that   promotes sustainability by reducing reliance on municipal water and fossil fuels. Additionally, it  aligns with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) princi ples by ensuring equitable access to  clean water during   critical situations , fostering community resilience, and encouraging collaborative  governance.   Furthermore, t he system’s modular design offers strong commercialization potential,  allowing   potential   de velopers to   invest and collaborate   into   the   new housing projects or retrofit older  communities. By addressing Malaysia’s water security challenges while supporting environmental  goals, the project positions itself as a transformative solution for sustainab le water management.  5.

However, ensuring plants receive sufficient water is essential for their growth and health. To address this challenge  while promoting environmental sustainability, we present the Auto   Waterer, an innovative, eco - friendly watering  system designed using recyclable materials. The Auto Waterer operates without the need for electricity or constant  human supervision, embodying the principles of the \\\"Go Green\\\" concept. Today, automatic waterin g systems with  automated features that depend on direct electricity or renewable energy such as solar energy conversion have been  developed. However, most of them are highly priced to get and install. Alternatively, auto waterer using rainwater  is more eco - friendly. Therefore, the proposed Auto Waterer was an initiative to overcome this problem. Leveraging  the principles of physics, specifically the Law of Gravity, the system utilizes collected rainwater stored in a tank.  Gravity enables the water to flow e fficiently to the plants. A specially designed cap with an adjustable nozzle ensures  precise control over the water flow, allowing for an ideal drip rate. In this innovation, two designs of Auto Waterer  were developed with different structures and function s each. Design A was built with three drains that function to  collect and flow rainwater into the auto waterer tank. In contrast, Design B consists of two water tanks that help to  store more rainwater. This innovation eliminates concerns about overwatering   or underwatering, offering a reliable  and sustainable solution for plant care. The Auto Waterer not only simplifies plant maintenance but also contributes  to conserving natural resources and protecting Mother Earth. Lastly, this innovation was proposed to   benefit the  agriculture industry.  Keywords:   Auto waterer; Green concept; Sustainable; Environmentally friendly; Portable.

INTRODUCTION  The study proposes a new auto - watering system meant to overcome common difficulties faced  by gardeners and farmers, such as limited time and the high cost of   automated systems. Unlike existing  solar - powered systems that require electricity (Eragamreddy & Sree, 2017), the suggested system  prioritizes sustainability by depending on rainfall and gravity for operation. It creates a simple and  cost - effective design   using recyclable materials such as plastic bottles, straws, and cotton, solving  disadvantages such as installation difficulty, high costs, and sensor errors. This eco - friendly solution  promotes the \\\"Go Green\\\" , the study of thought by removing the need for   energy, while also  maintaining healthy plant development through controlled water distribution utilizing modified  nozzles.  The study analyzed two auto - watering system designs on Capsicum Chinense (Habanero  pepper) plants, optimizing nozzle adjustments to   get the ideal water drip rate. This gravity - fed system  is complemented by a rainwater collection technology to ensure optimal water storage and utilization.  The study highlights the environmental and cost benefits of this technique over solar - powered  alte rnatives, which are more expensive and less effective in locations with variable sunlight (Chadly et  al., 2024; IRENA, 2023). China, for example, leads in solar PV production, however the resources  necessary for solar panel manufacturing increase costs and   have an environmental impact (Pourasl,  Barenji,   & Khojastehnezhad, 2023).   This innovative system,   which   uses gravity and   recyclable  materials, provides a sustainable, user - friendly irrigation solution while encouraging sustainable  practices in agriculture   and gardening.  2.   METHOD   &   MATERIAL  For Design A, it was designed using 1.5L plastic water bottle with cap, cotton, gauze, hard  straw, waterproof cardboard and flower hose for the auto waterer. Firstly, it started by making three  square holes at the bo ttom of the 1.5L water for about 3 cm from its base. Aside from that, three  cardboards were cut into 10 until 15 cm length and 6 cm width. Then,   the   cardboards were folded into  a square drain with 10 to 15 cm length, 2 cm height and 2 cm width. Next, the t hree drain cardboard  were secured with hot glue gun around it in a 30 𐩑 position as shown in Figure 1 . After that, a hard straw  was cut with a length of 3 cm and was filled in with cotton with compatibility that was suitable for the  water rate. A hole was   made in the centre of the bottle cap and it was the same size as the hard straw.  The hard straw was put inside the hole and was sealed using a hot glue gun. Meanwhile, the stand for  auto waterer was made using wires, U shaped nails and cable ties. The stan d holder was made with a  10 to 15 cm height, with the same diameter as the bottle while the feet was made with 23 to 25 cm  height; using wire, cable ties and U - s haped nails as shown in Figure   1. Lastly, the stand was poked into  the ground next to the plant   and the auto waterer was placed in it.  For Design B, the materials needed were the same as the Design A but without using the  waterproof cardboard and this design required two 1.5L water bottles. Firstly, one of the bottles was  cut into three parts which   are upper, middle and bottom. The bottle cap from the upper part was taken  out so that it can act as a funnel for the rainwater flow. Moreover, a gauze was glued and sealed at the  upper part but not the cap part to filter any substance from entering the a uto waterer. Then, the upper  part needs to be placed backwards into the b ottom part as shown in Figure   1. After that, both of the  bottles were glued together with each other, with the bottom part as the upper part of the auto waterer  using a hot glue gun.   Next, three holes were made at the bottom part of both bottles. A flower hose was  cut into three pieces of 8 cm length and each of them were inserted at each hole by pairing with each\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861503  124  other. The flower hoses were sealed into the hole using a hot glue gun.   After that, a hard straw was cut  with a length of 3 cm and was filled in with cotton with compatibility that was suitable for the water  rate. A hole was made in the centre of the bottle cap and it was the same size as the hard straw. The  hard straw was put   inside the hole and was sealed using a hot glue gun. Meanwhile, the stand for auto  waterer was also the same as Design A which was made using wires, U shaped nails and cable ties. The  stand holder was made with a 10 to 15 cm height, with the same diameter   as the bottle while the feet  was made with 23 to 25 cm height; using wire, cable ties and U - sh aped nails as shown in Figure   1.  Lastly, the stand was poked into the ground next to the plant and the auto waterer was placed in it.  Both designs were placed   next to each other in an open area that was exposed with the  rainwater for observation. The data of the observation for this study was taken every 2 - 3 days. The  observations𐩑included𐩑the𐩑plant’s𐩑growth,𐩑height𐩑and𐩑the𐩑conditions𐩑before𐩑and𐩑after𐩑the𐩑auto𐩑w aterer  applied.  Figure   1 .   The innovation designs .  3.   FINDINGS  The   result   of this research shows that by using an auto waterer system with rainwater as the  water source had improved the irrigation system effectiveness. It had reduced the water usage on ly by  utilizing𐩑 rainwater𐩑 without𐩑 depending𐩑 on𐩑 electricity.𐩑 The𐩑 system’s𐩑 potential𐩑 for𐩑 environmentally𐩑  friendly water management can be seen by its capacity to collect water from rainwater and store them  in the auto waterer for every rainfall. When compare d to traditional methods, this system can reduce  water waste while maintaining the soil moisture levels and proper soil hydration.  This research also discovered that it still   could   run without an external power source and  emphasizing𐩑 the𐩑 “Go𐩑 Green”𐩑 conce pt.   To   lower operating cost, this innovation makes the system  suitable for the areas with poor electrical access as it can be made using plastic materials and rainwater.  It provides an economical and sustainable method for traditional or electrical irrigat ion techniques  when it can benefit the uses in agriculture, especially to reduce cost of requirements.  First day   Last day  Figure   2 .   The Auto Waterer installation\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861503  125  4.   DISCUSSION  The primary purpose of the auto waterer that we design is the ability to store rainwater so that  the plant   receives enough water during drought season. Two designs for auto water have been  developed. For design A, the rainwater is collected by the drain, while design B collects it directly into  the auto waterer through a funnel made from plastic bottles. Both a uto waterers were installed on the  same𐩑plant𐩑species𐩑during𐩑testing.𐩑“Chilli𐩑Geronong,”𐩑or𐩑its𐩑scientific𐩑name,𐩑Capsicum𐩑Chinese,𐩑is𐩑the𐩑  plant that was chosen to test both designs of the auto water. Two auto - waterer designs were assessed  under the same en vironmental conditions. As a result, both designs of auto waterers successfully  maintain soil hydration, but their effects on the chilli plant differ. The contrasts are noticeable; design  A produces more chilli, and the leaves are greener and grow taller   than design B. This indicates that  auto waterer design AA performs better because it can store more water at a faster rate. Even though  Design B survived, the chilli plant that used Design A grew faster and healthier than the chilli plant  Design B. Howeve r, both of the designs have drawbacks. If the drought persists, the irrigation system  will be discontinued due to both of the tanks running dry. Therefore, the autowater er   cannot be used  in areas where the weather is extremely dry. With this observation, w e can conclude that Auto Waterer  Design A is more efficient than Auto Waterer Design B.  5.   CONCLUSION  In this Auto Waterer innovation, it demonstrates how the application of an automatic watering  system based on the principles of the \\\"Go Green\\\" concept and physics can benefit more water  sustainability and be environmentally friendly. This statement can be   proven as no electricity and  constant human supervision needed for them to operate. The components were made out of recycled  materials, which lead to reducing the plastic waste. Meanwhile, the use of rainwater and its water  retention feature can promote wa ter - saving even during drastic weather change. Two designs were  developed, where both designs applied the Gravity Law to flow the rainwater efficiently to the plant.  Besides that, both designs were constructed with the top of the tank closed to minimize ev aporation  process during hot weather. The innovative nozzle modification attached with the bottle cap was used  to control an ideal water drip for healthy plant growth. After taking into consideration, Design A is  more effective to water the plant. Neverthe less, this Auto Waterer design is only applicable in tropical  seasons which gives a limitation of the work because rainwater was used as the main water supply.  However, this innovation still can be adapted in related countries. For instance, countries alon g the  equatorial line which experience sunny and rainy days throughout the year can use this Auto Waterer  innovation. Last ly , this Auto Waterer innovation benefits the users, economy and nature.

Abstract:   Coffeeshop business often faced fierce competition with the emergence of new and existing competitors.  Customers often have considerable number of choices in deciding coffeeshop to satisfy their coffee needs. Basically,  many strategies have been implemente d to become the first choice of customer such as the introduction of signature  menu, interior design, friendly staff, and strategic location. However, only few   investigates   the utilization of ICT  advancement to capture customer engagement, satisfaction, an d loyalty. Due to the advancement of ICT, the  customer needs are further complicated thus, coffeeshop business need to utilize the benefits of ICT. As such, this  paper explores the implementation of gamified systems such as rewarding system that consists o f points, badges,  leaderboard,   and rankings to enhance customer experience. The implementation of gamified systems in the 1997  coffee shows the way to successfully increase customer experience, hence, it can be commercialized for other  coffeeshop to increa se their competitiveness through gamified systems.

INTRODUCTION  Gamified systems were used in business to increase customer engagement, satisfaction, and  loyalty (Durin i k, 2014; Vanick & Bui, 2014). Gamified systems include rew arding systems that  frequently reward the customer through points and badges. For instance, every purchase from  customer in the coffeeshop would receive points as rewards. These points can be used to claim other  rewards such as free cup of coffee, free cak es, and free meals. In term of badges, every order and  transactions of customer will be recorded and counted. If the customer has collected significant number  of orders, they will receive badge. This badge is systematically categorized ranging from premium   to  exclusive badges. The more orders customers have, the higher ranks badge they will receive. A higher  rank badges resulting in higher discount offers for the next purchase. The implementation of point and  badge systems have greatly influence customer en gagement, satisfaction, and loyalty ( Aljameel, 2020 ).  However, few coffeeshop business have implement these gamified systems into their business. Instead,  they are relying on traditional card punctuation for customer to receive free coffee as rewards. The   use\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DO I:   10.5281/zenodo.14861514  128  of punctuation cards   has   proved to significantly influence customer retention, however, the cards  sometimes can suffer from various issue, such as loss and damage. The implementation of gamified  systems by using the advancement of ICT would only requir e to scan the QR codes and filling up a  simple form , thus, they can have their own virtual profile. Moreover, they can edit their virtual profile  by filling more important information such as phone numbers, email, date of birth and flavour  preferences. Thi s information is stored in centralized database and proved to be valuable for coffeeshop  business to offer promotion, marketing, and give surprise and systematic rewards. By having this kind  of gamified systems, most likely the customer would feel valued t hus increase their retention,  engagement, satisfaction, and engagement because of the dopamine effect from the rewarding systems.  2.   LITERATURE REVIEW  Durin i k (2014) provides an overview of implementing gamification elements in KMS among  employee. Among t he gamified elements that we explored are points, badges, challenges and contests,  awards and prizes, and ranking and leaderboards. Durin i k (2014) explained how these gamified  elements   have   increase   employee   engagement   and   satisfaction.   This   is because   the   nature   of  competitiveness in human drives them to accept challenges and contest, in order to achieve higher  ranks in ranking and leaderboards. Once they achieved the coveted spot, the dopamine is released in  their brain hence influence their satisfaction   and engagement towards the system. The study of Durin i k  (2014) have provide direction for coffeeshop business owner to consider implementing these gamified  systems in order to increase their customer engagement towards the coffeeshop systems, hence  increas ing their satisfaction and loyalty. This enable the coffeeshop to gain competitive advantage  towards other coffeeshop that did not employ these gamified elements.  Warnick & Biu (2014) provide systematic analysis of 203 papers that address gamification  appl ications in various fields that includes finance, risk management, human resource management,  and corporate governance. This study has provided a framework towards implementing gamification  system in the management areas to increase employee engagement, wo rk rate, commitment, and  satisfaction. Moreover, the study has pinpointed a future direction towards investigating the impacts  of gamification systems towards employee work excellence. This paper focusing on gamification design  elements and strategy by top   management to alleviate their employee competitiveness to receive  recognition and rewards, hence, increasing the productivity of both employee and organization. The  study of Warnick &   Biu   (2014) highlighted the importance of designing and   strategizing the  gamification systems that includes the reward structure and challenges level. In the context of  coffeeshop business, the study of Warnick & Biu (2014) can be used as basis to design the gamified  systems in terms of how to structure the point and redeem sy stems, the requirement to achieve badge  and how to design the badges level for the rewards system.  Hamari et al., (2014) provide reviews on empirical studies on gamification and develop a  framework to evaluate the effects of gamification towards behavior al outcomes. The finding of the  study revealed that gamification significantly influenced positive behavioral outcomes, however, the  authors stated that despite the clear benefits of gamification, there is lack of research examining the  outcome of behavior   in related to gamification systems. It is important to note that, the authors  highlighted the positive effects of behavior however is related to the how gamification systems were  implemented as well as the kind of user using it. This study postulated that   the gamification systems  need to be carefully designed and the designer must take into consideration the kind of user that will  use the system. This study further supports the findings of Warnick & Biu (2014) that emphasized on  the design elements and str ategies in implementing gamified systems. Thus, for coffee business owners,  it is important to study and review the framework proposed by Warnick & Biu (2014) in designing the  gamification elements, in order to maximize the benefits of gamification systems   implementations.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DO I:   10.5281/zenodo.14861514  129  In relation to the gamification framework, the study of Kappen & Nacke (2013) further  highlights the strategy and creative design techniques of gamified systems in business applications.  The authors highlighted that the creator of the gam ification systems faced challenge in strategizing and  creating the structure of gamified elements in a playful way to maximize the engagement, satisfaction,  and loyalty. Kappen & Nacke (2013) explains there are limited framework and model for business  appl ication to effectively implement gamified systems to increase customer engagement, satisfaction,  and loyalty. The authors suggest that creator of gamified systems to delve into self - determination  theory and the principles of system design to inculcate the   gamification systems on business  application. Hence, the authors provide the design guideline to maximize the effects. From this study,  coffee business owners are able to refer to this guideline and framework to ensure maximize effect of  the gamified syste ms. This is because, in order to implement gamified systems, a significant amount of  money need to be spent on the rewards, system development, discounts, and other exclusive benefits.  3.   METHODS  By considering the frameworks of Warnick & Biu (2014) and H amari et al., (2014), as well as  the guideline provided by Kappen & Nacke (2013), this study implements the gamified systems  towards coffee shop business named The 1997 Coffee, which is located at Sungai Petani, Kedah, North  Malaysia. The website of The 19 97 Coffee was designed and gamified systems point and badges were  implemented in the website. For points, each Ringgit Malaysia (RM) purchase resulted 1 point for  customer. For instance, if the customer buys the coffee that the price is RM 10, then 10 poin ts will be  allocated to the customer account. Then, the points are redeemable started at 30 points, 50 points, 70  points, and 100 points. The higher the points, the more exclusive the rewards. The rewards for points  redemption includes free cup of coffee,   free layer of cakes, and free meals. For badges, customers are  able to view their progress via the order. Once a customer made order, they will receive 1 progression  point to acquire badges. The badges are categorized into three, namely, silver badge custo mer,  premium customer, and exclusive customer. In order to achieve silver badge, customer need to have  10 progression points via order, while to receive the premium customer badge, they need 30  progression points. Lastly, in order to received the coveted e xclusive badge, they would need 50  progression points. The silver badge enable customer to enjoy 5% of discount for every next purchase,  while the customer s   with premium badges   are   entitled to 10% of discount, whereas the exclusive  member enjoys 15% discou nt for every purchase.   These gamified systems   were designed in accordance  with the frameworks proposed by Warnick & Biu (2014) and Hamari et al., (2014), as well as following  the guideline proposed by Kappen & Nacke (2013).  4.   FINDINGS  Customer would be   able to purchase even without registering to the system, this is to give the  autonomy for the customer. Autonomy is proved to significantly affect customer behavior in which  majority of customer dislikes if they have limited options or empowerment. This is   the gamification  guideline as proposed by Kappen & Nacke (2013) as the gamification elements would allow autonomy  and empowerment for clients to feel in control to made decisions. However, the employee would  politely suggest to the customer if they regist er by completing minimal form, they would be able to  receive points, badges, and gifts. The employee plays a crucial role towards persuading customer to  register. Figure 1   shows   the registration form for the customer.  After registration, customer would be   able to view their profile in the system. In their profile  page, there are two tabs, namely profile and badges & progress. In the profile page, customer would be  able to see clearly their current points . The points will be given in accordance to their pur chase, for\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DO I:   10.5281/zenodo.14861514  130  instance, every RM1 spent the customer would receive 1 point. Below the points, the customer is  greeted with their given name, and their personal information such as email, address, profile picture,  phone number, date of birth, and favorite drin ks. In this personal information section, the customer is  given the options to edit their information at any time. Other than that, their purchase history, points  earned, and current point are displayed along with the recent transactions. By providing this  information, the customer would feel satisfied as every purchased is seen as being valued by the coffee  shop ( Wunderlich et al., 2019 ). In the badges & progress tab, customer would be able to monitor their  progress towards achieving the coveted badges. By   providing the real time feedback monitoring, this  would increase the eagerness of the customer to engage more with the system, in order to unlock the  coveted badges ( Herzig et al., 2015 ). Figure 2 and Figure 3 depicts the customer profile and badges &  pro gress tab respectively.  F igure 1 .   Registration Form   F igure   2 .   Customer Profile   F igure   3 .   Badges & Progress  Customer are allowed to browse the menu available via coffeeshop website by scanning the  QR code. After the customer made their choice, they can just click add to cart whatever drinks and  meals that they preferred. After confirming the transaction, custome r would see the points being  allocated to their profile. Figure 4 shows how the system allocate points to the customer. After having  significant number of points, customer able to view the redeem tab in the website to see what they can  redeem from the poin ts they gained. If they decide to redeem the items, their point will be deducted  based on the points required to redeem the items. This technique is proven to influence customer  satisfaction and engagement. Figure 5 depicts the redeem tab for customer.  ] \\\\  F igure   4 .   Points Allocation   F igure   5 .

DISCUSSION  The effort to implement gamified system in coffeeshop business is to increase customer  engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty   (Aljameel, 2020; Hamari et al., 2014; Wanick   & Bui, 2014)   given  the fierce competition coffeeshop are entitled to. The gamification system work wonders due to the  release of dopamine in the brain of customer when they receive certain rewards   (Pacewicz, 2015) . When  the dopamine is released, customer   would feel satisfied, thrilled, enjoyed, and mesmerized thus most  likely to repeat the purchase and engage more with the system. Coffee business nowadays should  include gamification systems in their business to increase their competitiveness and give them   edge  over their competitors by providing gifts and rewards to their customer via gamification systems. The  implementation of gamification systems however, need considerable strategies and techniques to  maximized benefits. In order to successfully implement   gamification systems, coffeeshop owners are  advised   to   follow   the   frameworks   and   guidelines   that   have   been   provided   by   researchers,  academicians, and scholars   (Kappen & Nacke, 2013; Wanick & Bui, 2014; Hamari et al., 2014) .  Dopamine is the chemical in hu man brain that is released upon triggers ( Pacewicz, 2015)  Dopamine has the effect to made human feel addicted, this is why the gaming industry generated  billions of dollars per year   (The Forbes, 2023) . They instil the well - structured gamified systems such   as  the challenges and events, the point and badge systems, as well as leaderboard and ranking systems.  Their user would feel enjoyment, excitement,   and   exhilarating   once they received points, achieve  badges, earning coveted ranking in the leaderboards beca use the dopamine has been greatly released  by their brains   (Pacewicz, 2015) . This   dopamine would make them addicted to the game, hence increase  their engagement, thus triggers them to made purchase the in - game virtual assets such as coins,  weapons, players , and others to give them competitive advantage over their rivals   (Wunderlich et al.,  2019) . This dopamine effect has been greatly studied and been instil in other context, such as coffeeshop  business.  6. CONCLUSION  Gamified systems need to be implemented not only in coffeeshop business, but in other  domains such as barbershop, car & motorcycle workshop, saloon & beauty, groceries shop, shopping  complex, and hardware shops. This is because the gamified systems have be en proven to significantly  increase the customer engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty. The gamification systems are capable to  trigger the dopamine release in the human brains, enhancing their overall experience and feel attached  emotionally towards the p roduct or brand. Gamified system also should be implemented in other  domain such as academics, banking, architecture, aviation, and medical to further advance the areas.  References  Aljameel, O. (2020).

INTRODUCTION  Solar Power Rover provides such innovation in   the frontline towards the energy break -  reminder and will power electric users further to easily have assessors to charging infrastructural  options. Due to more or   less high   EVs coming right from across different continents and time, part of  the most seriou s factors can boil to a lack of a valid solution for access or ways where persons could  have offered charges comfortably: particularly for these unreachable territorial localities or generally  far - fetched regions in relation. The Solar Power Rover overcome s these limitations by harnessing  renewable solar energy in a compact, portable form factor that combines functionality with ease of use.  This innovative charging station was designed to help EV users seeking mobility, reliability, and  sustainability in th eir charging solutions. With the foldable solar panels, it will be very effective in every  type of environment. Sleek and lightweight in its design, this is to be functional and easy to carry with.  The Rover will be a very powerful solution for clients who   make use of clean sources of energy. Target  customers include outdoor enthusiasts, emergency responses, and EV owners within areas of poor  infrastructural development. By integrating state - of - the - art solar technology with a modular and user -\r\n\r\nAPS Proceed ings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861527  134  friendly desig n, the Solar Power Rover supports not only the growing adoption of electric vehicles but  also global efforts in reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. This invention shows  commitment to the development of green technology in solving real - world challenges in sustainable  transportation and marks a significant step toward a cleaner, more energy - efficient future.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  This   project aims to develop a Solar Power Rover that can charge electric vehicles (EVs) using  solar energy an d traditional grid energy anywhere we   bring the Solar Power Rover. The authors consist  of   students working on the design and planning,   thus, the   focus is on understanding the aspects of  solar power, energy efficiency , and electric vehicle charging . The met hodology involves a detailed  process of research, simulation, and 3D modeling to present a comprehensive plan for the product.  The approach begins with extensive research into solar energy systems, battery technologies,  and EV charging methods. The goal is   to ensure the design is both practical and energy - efficient.  Theoretical simulations and virtual modeling tools such as FreeCAD were used to create a visual  representation of the rover and simulate the functionality of the solar - powered system. These  comp onents were chosen with consideration for size, energy efficiency, and compatibility.  2.1   Proc esse s of making the conceptualization of the Solar Power Rover  i.   Conceptualization and Design:  It   started with in - depth research on solar power systems, battery   technologies, and electric  vehicle charging methods.   We visualize the Solar Power Rover to efficiently charge EVs while  being compact and lightweight.   We selected components such as solar panels, batteries, and  charge controllers that provide maximum energ y efficiency for a system that fits within the  70x50x40cm space constraints of the rover.  ii.   3D Modeling:  We used FreeCAD for 3D modeling to design the solar rover. We focused the modeling process  on visualizing the rover’s size, layout, and optimal placement   for solar panels, batteries, and  other components.   T his is just a concept visualization. In future the design will be more realistic  and user - friendly .   We ensured that the components fit within the size of 70x50x40 cm, ensuring  that all components are arr anged in a compact and functional manner.  Figure 1.

Energy Calculations:  We calculated the energy requirements for the rover, taking into the amount the energy output  of the solar panels, the battery capacity, and the energy   consumption of the rover’s components.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceed ings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861527  138  We estimate the time required for the solar panels to charge the battery fully, as well as the  expected charging times for different EV models by calculating with the mathematics formula  such as Aggregate,Series and C umulative Total. This includes simulating the solar - to - battery  efficiency and understanding the battery’s charge - discharge cycles.  1 . Analysing the Solar Battery Charge Time for the Solar Power Rover:  The charging analysis for the Yilink   YL - S48200 (48V, 200Ah) battery indicates that with a Depth  of Discharge (DOD) of 90%, the battery requires approximately 28.42 peak sun hours or one  day and four hours to fully recharge. This calculation utilizes a solar setup of 320W total panel  wattage   and an MPPT charge controller, which ensures efficient power conversion. The  estimated charge time reflects optimal sunlight conditions, emphasizing the importance of  peak sun availability for the Solar Power Rover’s performance. This calculation was made  using the JMH Power Solar Panel Charge Time Calculator.The Solar Power Rover uses a 3 - pin  input for grid charging with 240V AC(Malaysian standard 3pin socket output volt) .The  20000W Carmear inverter converts AC to DC to charge the 9.6kWh battery. The DALY   48V  145A BMS ensures safe and efficient charging by managing the battery\\\'s charge levels. This  system provides a reliable way to charge the rover when solar power is unavailable.  2 . Comprehensive Energy Management System for the Solar Power Rover:  Solar P ower Rover has essential components for efficient energy management. The Yilink YL -  S48200 (48V, 200Ah) battery, with 9.6 kWh capacity and 90% Depth of Discharge (DOD),  powers the rover’s systems. The Victron Energy SmartSolar MPPT 100/30 charge controller  ensures optimal conversion of energy from the four 320W solar panels. The Daly 48V 145A  BMS protects the battery during charge and discharge cycles. A Carmear 20000W 60V inverter  converts DC to AC power for the rover’s components, while the Noctua NF - A14 c ooling fan  manages temperature. Energy data is displayed on the Nextion 7\\\" Touchscreen, and Anker  USB - A + USB - C modules provide mobile charging options. The rover also includes CCS Type  2 and CHAdeMO fast charging sockets for external charging. A 3 - pin inp ut from a generic  universal socket allows for grid charging at 240V. The Aluminum Alloy Chassis provides  structural strength, and fuse protection circuits ensure safety. This combination of components  delivers a reliable, efficient, and safe solar - powered   rover.  3.   Solar Power Production and Charging Efficiency of the Solar Power Rover:  In this report we calculated the solar power production for the Solar Power Rover, using four  80W solar panels with a total output of 320W. With 8 peak sun hours per day, th e system  generates 2.56 kWh of energy daily. After accounting for the MPPT charge controller’s 95%  efficiency, the effective energy production is 2.432 kWh per day. Based on this, the time taken  to fully charge the rover’s 9.6 kWh battery is estimated to b e approximately 28.22 hours using  solar energy. Additionally, for grid charging, assuming an efficiency of 85%, the energy  required from the grid would be slightly higher due to offset during conversion.  4 .

Moreover, the  internationalization of Malaysian higher education introduces further challenges.   Dobbin and Kale v  (2022)   discusse d   how the increasing diversity of the student body complicates the grading process, as  educators must navigate varying cultural expectations and learning styles, which can impact the  objectivity and fairness of assessments.   Addressing thes e challenges requires innovative solutions that  enhance grading precision and efficiency.   EZmarking   emerges as a targeted response   by   offering a  specialized calculator designed to streamline the grading process, particularly for project management  evalu ations involving Gantt charts.   By providing simplified input options for fractional marks   such as  0.25, 0.5, 1, and   2 , EZmarking   enables educators to apply precise grades efficiently   by   reducing the  cognitive load and potential for error inherent in manual   calculations.   The implementation of  EZmarking   promises several benefits . Firstly, s tandardized marking inputs help align grading practices  across different educators and institutions   by   addressing concerns of inconsistency and subjectivity.  S econdly, s imp lifying the grading process allows educators to allocate more time to providing  qualitative feedback   which   enrich the learning experience for students.   The n, the   use of precise  fractional marks ensures that student evaluations accurately reflect   their   perf ormance   and contribute  to   fairer outcomes.  From a commercialization perspective,   EZmarking   holds significant potential.   It has been  registered under MYIPO.   Its user - friendly design and targeted functionality make it an attractive tool  for   educational   insti tutions   globally,   especially   those   seeking   to   enhance   their   assessment  methodologies.   By addressing a critical need in the education sector,   EZmarking   is poised to contribute  to the broader goals of promoting fairness and accuracy in academic evaluations.  Figure   1 .   Interface of   EZMarking\r\n\r\nAPS Pro ceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861535  146  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  Based on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) by John Sweller, the principle behind   EZmarking  creation   is to   focus on the management of working memory and emphasizes reducing unnecessary  cognitive load to   enhance learning and task performance.   The development of   EZ m arking   involved a  comprehensive   process   that   utilized   Python   programming   for   prototyping,   functionality  implementation, and testing. Python\\\'s versatility and ease of use made it an ideal choice for developing  the software logic and interfacing with hardware comp onents.  Figure   2 .   EZmarking’s   Research Design and Development Process  The system design phase utilized Python to build the software logic for handling fractional  marks like 0.25, 0.5, and 2. The Python code was structured to ensure accurate real - time ca lculations  and seamless interaction with the hardware. The logic incorporated numerical processing using Python  libraries such as   N umpy   for precise computation and   Tkinter   to create a graphical interface for initial  simulations. These simulations enabled the development team to visualize the workflow and refine the  user interface before hardware assembly.   The prototyping stage involved integrating Python with a  Raspberry Pi   microcontroller. Tactile buttons were connected to the microcontroller and programmed  using Python’s GPIO libraries to simulate the grading inputs. An LCD display was interfaced with the  Raspberry Pi to show real - time outputs   to   ensur e   immediate feedback   for the user. During this phase,  Python scripts were extensively tested to log button inputs, calculate results accurately and detect error .  Testing and refinement were integral to the development process. Educators participated in  usability tests to eval uate the functionality and accuracy of the device. Python was used to log user  interactions and identify areas for improvement. Feedback from this phase led to modifications in both  hardware design and software logic, enhancing the overall user experience.   Python’s debugging tools  were instrumental in resolving issues, particularly in handling edge cases such as multiple rapid inputs  or errors in fractional calculations.   The final assembly of   EZ m arking   combined a Python - powered  software platform with robust   hardware components.   The tactile input buttons were pre - labeled with  specific grading values (e.g., 0.25, 0.5,   - 0.25) to facilitate intuitive use. Python’s lightweight and versatile  nature allowed the software to run efficiently on the hardware, providing   consistent performance.  The outcome of this methodical approach was a user - friendly, precise, and efficient   application  grading tool tailored to the needs of educators. The use of Python throughout the development process  ensured a high level of accuracy   and flexibility   by   enabling the creation of a device that addresses\r\n\r\nAPS Pro ceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861535  147  critical challenges in modern grading systems.   EZ m arking   stands out as an innovative solution for  enhancing the grading experience, particularly in project management evaluations.  3.

Its quick startup, accurate  input processing, and accessibility features make it an invaluable tool for   educators. The app’s ability  to streamline grading processes, reduce errors, and enhance efficiency confirms its potential for broad  deployment and adoption in educational settings.\r\n\r\nAPS Pro ceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861535  149  4. DISCUSSION  One of the most profound impacts of   EZ m arking   lies in its ability to save time for educators.  Traditional grading processes, especially those requiring detailed evaluations and fractional marks,  often involve manual calculations that are time - consuming and prone to errors.   Wormeli (2023)  highlight ed   that traditional grading methods often consume a significant portion of educators’ working  hours, with complex assessments requiring detailed attention, thus reducing the time available for  feedback and lesson preparation. The app automates these calculati ons, allowing educators to input  fractional values such as +0.25, +0.5, or   - 0.25 with a single tap, addressing the inefficiency identified in  these traditional methods. Automation in grading, as noted by   Stevens and Levi (2023),   reduces the  time taken   and   the likelihood of errors caused by manual processes, further improving reliability in  assessment.  The app’s performance metrics, including a startup time of just 413 milliseconds, further  underscore its efficiency. Studies like those conducted by   Chen et.   al. (2023)   indicate d   that quick access  to grading tools can have a substantial impact on educators’ productivity, particularly in high - pressure  scenarios such as final exams or project evaluations. Educators can launch the app and begin grading  almost inst antly, which is particularly beneficial during such high - stakes assessments. By streamlining  the grading process, the app saves time   and   allows educators to allocate more attention to qualitative  aspects of   assessment, such as providing constructive feedba ck to students. This aligns with the  findings of   Pan and Yang (2021)   who emphasi s ed that reducing the time spent on administrative  grading tasks enables educators to focus on delivering formative feedback, thereby enhancing the  overall learning experience   for students.  A nother critical impact of   EZ m arking   is its role in enhancing grading accuracy and consistency.  Research b y   Caterino et. al. (2023)   h ighlight ed   that manual grading systems are often susceptible to  human error, particularly when dealing with c omplex assessments involving fractional marks. The app  ensures that fractional marks are calculated with precision, which is essential for assessments requiring  detailed point allocations, thereby addressing the inconsistencies identified in traditional me thods.  Additionally, studies by   Krebs et. al. (2022)   emphasi sed   that subjective interpretations of grading  rubrics frequently lead to variability in scoring, which can undermine the perceived fairness of  assessments. The app mitigates these risks by standa rdizing the input and calculation processes,  ensuring that every student’s work is evaluated against the same criteria, thereby aligning with best  practices for maintaining grading reliability.  Consistency is further supported by the app’s intuitive interf ace, which minimizes the  likelihood of input errors. Previous research by   Wens and Walters (2022)   the impact of intuitive grading  technologies shows that well - designed digital tools reduce cognitive load for educators and improve  the accuracy of grade entr y. Educators can confidently assign grades using the app, knowing that the  calculations will be accurate and impartial. This is particularly important in fostering trust and  transparency in the assessment process, as highlighted by   Darvishi et. al. (2022)   who found that  consistent and transparent grading practices significantly enhance stakeholder confidence in the  educational system. By ensuring that grades are both accurate and fair,   EZ m arking   contributes to  building a more equitable and reliable assessme nt process.  The app’s ability to handle complex grading schemes with fractional marks also contributes to  greater equity and fairness in educational assessment. Many traditional grading tools lack the  granularity needed to reflect subtle differences in stu dent performance, often forcing educators to  round grades up or down. This limitation has been highlighted by   Sireci and Randall (2021)   who argued  that such practices can obscure the true performance of students, potentially disadvantaging those who  perfor m at the margins of grading thresholds. Research by   Mordell and Gerdin (2022)   further\r\n\r\nAPS Pro ceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861535  150  corroborates this   by   demonstrating that rounding grades can create perceptions of unfairness,  particularly when small differences in performance significantly impact fina l outcomes.  EZ m arking   addresses this issue by allowing educators to assign precise grades that accurately  reflect each student’s performance. For instance, a student who earns 0.75 marks on a particular task  can be awarded exactly that amount, rather than   being rounded to the nearest whole number, which  aligns with recommendations by   Urhahne and Wijniw (2021) . Their study emphasized that granular  and precise grading systems are essential for promoting fairness and ensuring that students are  evaluated on the ir actual achievements rather than arbitrary thresholds. By offering such precision,  EZ m arking   ensures that all students are evaluated equitably and transparently, fostering trust in the  grading process.   In doing so, the app aligns with contemporary educat ional principles that emphasize  fairness and inclusivity.   Caterino et. al. (2023)   discussed how digital tools that enable precise and  consistent assessments contribute to more inclusive education systems by minimizing biases and  discrepancies in grading.   E Z m arking   demonstrates this by bridging the gap between traditional grading  limitations and modern pedagogical practices, ensuring that every student\\\'s performance is recognized  and rewarded accurately.  The app’s intuitive design and streamlined   functionality also have a direct impact on educator  productivity. Studies by   Krebs et. al. (2022)   highlight ed   that repetitive grading tasks, particularly those  involving manual calculations, can significantly detract from educators’ capacity to engage in h igher -  order responsibilities, such as curriculum development and student mentorship. By automating tasks  such as adding or subtracting fractional marks,   EZ m arking   reduces the cognitive load on educators and  allows them to dedicate more time to meaningful a spects of their role, such as designing effective  assessments and engaging in professional development. This aligns with findings by   Andrade et. al.  (2021), who emphasized that automating routine assessment tasks can improve teacher effectiveness  by enabli ng them to allocate more time to pedagogically valuable activities.  The app’s \\\"RESET\\\" function, which allows educators to clear inputs and start over quickly,  further enhances productivity by streamlining the process of revising grades or correcting errors .  Research by   Wormeli (2023)   noted that intuitive features in educational technology, such as reset  functions or simplified workflows, reduce friction in usage and enhance educators\\\' efficiency in  managing assessments. Additionally, the app’s compatibility   with modern Android devices ensures  that it can be integrated seamlessly into educators’ workflows. Stud y   by Perryman et al. (202 4 )  demonstrated that the availability of accessible, mobile - friendly grading tools reduces the barriers to  adoption and minimi zes the need for extensive technical expertise or training, making such tools  practical for   widespread   use in   educational settings.   These findings reinforce the potential of  EZMarking   to   significantly   enhance   educator   productivity   while   maintaining   ease   of   use   and  adaptability.  The scalability of the   EZMarking   app is another noteworthy finding. Its lightweight design and  compatibility with Android devices make it accessible to a wide range of users, from individual  educators to large educational institution s. The app’s ability to handle diverse grading schemes,  including those with fractional marks, ensures that it can be adapted to various educational contexts  and disciplines.   For instance, in project - based learning environments, where assessments often inv olve  multiple criteria and detailed point allocations, the app provides a reliable and efficient grading tool.  Similarly, in standardized testing scenarios, the app can be used to ensure uniformity and fairness  across large cohorts of students. This adapta bility enhances the app’s utility and broadens its potential  impact on education.   By leveraging digital tools to streamline grading processes, the app supports  educators in meeting the demands of modern classrooms, where technology integration is increasin gly  seen as a necessity rather than an option.\r\n\r\nAPS Pro ceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861535  151  5. CONCLUSION  The adoption of   EZ m arking   represents a transformative leap toward efficiency, accuracy, and  equity in education. In an era where educators are increasingly burdened by administrative tasks, tools  like   EZ m arking   empower teachers to focus on what truly matters   which is   the holistic development of  their students. Its precise fractional grading capabilities ensure that every student is evaluated fairly  and transparently, fostering trust and confidence   in the assessment process. Moreover, its intuitive  design and compatibility with modern devices make it accessible to educators of all technological  proficiencies   by   ensuring a seamless transition into classrooms and institutions of varying scales.  By red ucing the cognitive load associated with manual grading and eliminating common  errors,   EZ m arking   allows educators to reallocate their time and energy to providing constructive  feedback, mentoring, and enhancing their teaching strategies. These impacts ripp le outward   by  benefiting students and improving learning outcomes, while also contributing to the broader goals of  equity and inclusivity in education. In an increasingly digital world, integrating such technology into  the educational workflow is no longer   optional but necessary for keeping pace with modern demands.  EZ m arking   is an enabler of better teaching practices and a driver of improved educational  standards. To hesitate in adopting such innovation is to risk falling behind in meeting the needs of  tod ay’s students and educators. Embracing   EZ m arking   is a commitment to excellence, fairness, and  progress in education. It is a call to action for educators and institutions to align with 21st - century  educational   values and   leverage technology to create   a mor e   efficient   and   equitable   learning  environment.

Firebase is u tilized as the database, offering a  secure and real - time solution for managing and storing data.  The primary goal of Pocket PSPD is to create an interactive and engaging learning experience.  For students, the platform not only facilitates access to resou rces but also allows them to participate in  quizzes, receive instant grades, and review answers to improve their understanding. The ability to\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861550  154  retake quizzes makes it a valuable tool for revision and exam preparation. Additionally, students can  gain extra   knowledge through videos uploaded by their lecturers, helping them grasp complex topics  more effectively.  For lecturers, Pocket PSPD provides an efficient way to monitor students’ progress and identify  areas requiring additional support. Lecturers can ea sily upload and organize materials, ensuring that  students have consistent access to updated content. By fostering better communication and resource  management, Pocket PSPD promotes a collaborative learning environment that benefits both students  and lectu rers, ultimately contributing to improved academic outcomes.  2.   METHOD AND MATERIAL  2.1   Planning P hase  During the planning phase, we focus on defining the project\\\'s goals, scope, and deliverables  clearly. The team collects requirements by analysing the pr oblem statement and gathering feedback  from both students and lecturers. Students share their frustrations with finding the right materials for  the Problem Solving and Program Design (PSPD) subject, while lecturers provide insights into the  challenges of d elivering and managing these resources effectively. Additionally, we draw from our  own experiences as students and educators to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the issues.  This collaborative approach helps us identify key problems and devise practi cal solutions that align  with the system\\\'s primary objectives, creating a platform that meets the needs of all users.  2.2 Design Phase  Before moving to the development phase, we gather   project   requirements and outline basic  application   functions   using   a   flowchart.   Once   the   flowchart   is   prepared,   we use a context diagram to  illustrate   the   flow   of   information   between   the   system   and   external   entities.   Building on the context  diagram,   we   elaborate   on   the   process   using   a   Data   Flow   Diagram   (DFD).   Additionally,   we   use   a  relationship   diagram   to   depict   the   connections   between tables in our database. This design specifies  hardware   and   system   requirements   and   helps   process   owners visualize the complete system.  2.3 Development Phase  The development phase, following   the Agile methodology, is where we write and build the  system. The design serves as a guideline to ensure the system is developed as planned. Regular checks  and tests are conducted throughout this phase to identify and fix any issues, such as bugs and erro rs,  as early as possible. Our web application is created using Visual Studio, with JavaScript and React as  the front - end framework and Python with Django as the back - end framework. Firebase is used as the  database, providing a secure and real - time solution   for data management. By focusing on careful  development and thorough testing, we aim to deliver a robust and user - friendly web application that  meets the project\\\'s objectives and provides a seamless experience for its users.  2.4 Testing Phase  The   testing   phase   in   Agile   is   vital   for   ensuring   software   quality and functionality. During  testing,   we   focus   on   user   satisfaction by thoroughly checking if the software meets   their needs and  works   well.   Users   are   involved   in   the   process, providing feedback, and   testing the system in   different  scenarios.   We use various types of testing,   including Unit Testing for individual parts, Integration\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861550  155  Testing   for   combining   parts,   and   User   Acceptance   Testing   to see how real users interact with the  system.  2.5   Deployment   P ha se  The deployment phase in Agile is the last step where the   software is released to users. This  involves preparing   the   software for use by packaging and installing it in the   i ntended environment.  Tasks like   setting up servers and   connecting databases are   part of this process. By deploying   the  software, we   make it accessible to users, including   students and   Lecturers   from   Polytechnic   Malaysia ,  so they   can access new features and improvements. The system   is available online and the link is  provided to the us ers.  2.6   Review   P hase  During this phase, the main goal is to collect feedback from process owners, including lecturers  and students, to assess the system\\\'s effectiveness. Through interactive demos, meetings, and user  feedback, the team identifies any issue s and areas for improvement. This feedback is crucial for refining  the system, making necessary adjustments, and ensuring that it meets the needs of POCKET PSPD. By  involving users in the review process, POCKET PSPD aims to deliver a solution that enhances  operational efficiency and improves the learning experience for both lecturers and students.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861550  156  Figure 1 .

Abstract:   Microsleep   is   characterized by brief and involuntary sleep episodes, and is a critical safety issue linked to  accidents, particularly in transportation. Factors such as long working hours and unhealthy habits exacerbate the  prevalence of drowsiness - related incidents. Th is research presents an IoT - enabled Drowsy Driver Alert System  designed to mitigate microsleep risks and enhance road safety. The system integrates a heart rate sensor, IoT  connectivity and real - time alerts, including vibrations and mist diffusion, to   avoi d   accidents caused by drowsy  driving. Employing a transmitter - receiver setup, the system detects heart rate fluctuations indicative of microsleep  and triggers immediate alerts to re - energize the driver. Prototyped and validated through rigorous simulations   and  real - world testing, the system demonstrated over 75% connectivity reliability and effective operation within a 2 -  meter range. Furthermore, its email notification feature achieved a 77% success rate, ensuring timely alerts even in  passive monitoring sc enarios. This affordable, user - friendly innovation addresses limitations of existing solutions,  providing a scalable approach to road safety. By reducing drowsiness - related incidents, this system contributes  significantly to accident prevention strategies   and underscores the potential of IoT in safety - critical applications.  Future improvements, including enhanced sensor calibration and alternative communication methods, could further  refine system accuracy and robustness.

INTRODUCTION  Microsleep refers to brief, involuntary episodes of sleep or drowsiness lasting a few seconds.  During these episodes, individuals may lose awareness and fail to respond to their surroundings.  Microsleep can occur suddenly, often without th e person realizing it. Signs include drooping eyelids,  slow blinks and nodding off. This   brings   serious dangers to tasks requiring constant attention, like  driving or operating machinery, as individuals often remain unaware of these lapses.  Driver   tirednes s   is a major cause of road accidents, as it slows reaction times and reduces focus  (Phillips, 2015). Microsleep episodes, common among tired drivers, can lead to severe consequences  (Cajochen et al., 2003). Research has shown that physiological signs like   heart rate variability and eye  movement can signal   tiredness   and drowsiness (Akerstedt et al., 2002). Various detection methods,  including wearable sensors and in - car systems, have been developed to address this issue (Bai et al.,  2015 ) ( Lal and Craig, 200 1). However, many are costly, intrusive or not practical for daily use.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861558  174  Accidents caused by microsleep are a growing concern due to long work hours, heavy  workloads and unhealthy lifestyles. There is a   high   need for better solutions to   avoid   drowsy driving  occurring   and improve road safety. This project aims to create an IoT - based system to detect and  address microsleep, focusing on heart rate monitoring and using an essential oil diffuser to refresh and  alert drivers .   The system will use IoT technology to   monitor heart rate as a key indicator of   exhaustion .  It will include sensors and actuators to detect microsleep in real time and provide timely alerts. Unlike  current methods, this system will be cost - effective, non - intrusive   and suitable for regular use.  Microsleep is responsible for thousands of road accidents annually, often with devastating  consequences.   Tiredness   impacts   reaction times and decision - making, increasing the risk of crashes  (Phillips, 2015). Existing solutions, like eye - tracking and brainwave analysis, are often expensive or  difficult to implement (Lal and Craig, 2001 )   ( Cajochen et al., 2003). This project pr oposes a more  practical alternative by integrating heart rate monitoring with an essential oil diffuser. Studies confirm  that heart rate variability is a reliable indicator of fatigue (Akerstedt et al., 2002). The system aims to  offer a simple yet effectiv e way to detect and prevent drowsiness, contributing to safer roads.  In summary, microsleep is a significant safety issue, especially in driving. This project focuses  on developing a practical IoT - based solution to detect fatigue and microsleep, using hear t rate  monitoring and driver refreshment methods. By addressing the limitations of current systems, this  research aims to reduce accidents caused by driver fatigue and improve overall road safety.  2. M ETHOD & MATERIAL  This project features two main compon ents: the transmitter (T x ) and the receiver (R x ). The T x  device includes a NodeMCU microcontroller, a heart rate sensor, and a buzzer, while the R x   unit  contains another NodeMCU, a mist module, and a relay that activates a diffuser to release mist as an  al ert mechanism. The design was tested using Proteus software to ensure functionality before  implementation. A mobile app is used to set heart rate thresholds, monitor real - time data, and trigger  alerts when needed, offering an efficient solution to help pre vent drowsiness - related risks.  The T x   device continuously monitors the user\\\'s heart rate using the MAX30102 sensor, sending  the data to the NodeMCU. If the heart rate falls below a predefined threshold, set via the mobile app,  the NodeMCU triggers the buzz er. The R x   unit receives a signal via Wi - Fi from the T x , activating a  relay that turns on the mist module to release a refreshing mist. Additionally, the mobile app shows  real - time heart rate data, sends email notifications, and alerts the user via the buz zer and mist module  to ensure timely responses to potential risks.  The NodeMCU ,   a   versatile   open - source   IoT platform   featuring   the ESP8266   or   ESP32  microcontroller, plays a key role in this heart rate monitoring system by processing data from the  MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter sensor and triggering alerts when the heart rate falls below a   pre - set  threshold. It also controls the activation of a diffuser and connects to the Blynk mobile app for real - time  monitoring and notifications. The MAX30102 sensor, a compact and energy - efficient device, measures  both heart rate and oxygen saturation, se nding the data to the NodeMCU for processing. When the  heart rate dips too low, a buzzer emits a sound to alert the user. Powering the system is a lithium - ion  battery, known for its high energy density, long lifespan, and lightweight design, ensuring relia ble and  continuous operation. The battery is recharged through a battery charging board, which ensures safe  and efficient charging by regulating voltage and current, with LED indicators to monitor the charging  status. Together, these components form an int egrated and efficient heart rate monitoring and alert  system.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861558  175  Blynk, an IoT platform, is used in this project to monitor the user\\\'s heart rate in real time. It  enables the setting of personalized heart rate thresholds and sends alerts when these thresholds   are  crossed. The app also provides a graphical representation of heart rate data, enhancing the user\\\'s ability  to manage the system. The simple and user - friendly app interface allows for easy monitoring and  control, helping improve user awareness and road   safety.  This project integrates environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Environmentally, it  uses a rechargeable lithium - ion battery, reducing the reliance on disposable batteries and minimizing  electronic waste. The mist module, which can use   essential oils, provides a natural alternative to  chemical - based solutions. Socially, the system enhances safety by monitoring heart rate and alerting  users to potential microsleep risks, thus improving driving conditions. Economically, the use of  affordab le components like the NodeMCU and heart rate sensor, combined with the rechargeable  battery, reduces operational costs. The compact and user - friendly design of the devices ensures  portability and ease of use, making the system a practical and sustainable   solution.  3. FINDINGS  The data collected through experiments and testing were   analysed   to evaluate the system\\\'s  effectiveness in detecting microsleep and enhancing road safety. Key aspects of the analysis focused on  the performance of the heart rate monit oring sensor, the responsiveness of the essential oil diffuser, and  the overall reliability of the system in real - world scenarios. The experiments tested the connection  between the Transmitter (T x ) and Receiver (R x ) devices at varying distances, ranging fr om 0.5 meters  to 2 meters, to identify the most efficient operational range. Additionally, the system\\\'s ability to send  and receive email notification alerts in response to low heart rate readings was assessed, providing  insights into the system\\\'s effectiv eness in detecting drowsiness and delivering timely alerts to prevent  accidents.  3.1 Literature Review  Microsleep detection has been explored through several innovative approaches, particularly  for high - risk activities like driving. One example is the WAKE   system, which uses a behind - the - ear  wearable to capture critical   bio signals   like EEG, EOG, EMG, and EDA. This system offers a socially  acceptable format for monitoring and utilizes a novel signal processing technique to reduce motion  artifacts and enviro nmental noise. The system\\\'s performance, demonstrated through tests with sleep -  deprived and narcoleptic subjects, showed an average precision of 76% and a recall of 85%. Despite its  advantages, WAKE faces challenges such as environmental noise interference   and user acceptance.  Future research will focus on improving signal processing algorithms and exploring additional   bio  signal   modalities to enhance detection accuracy and broaden adoption (Shah et al., 2021).  In addition to wearable solutions, other research has focused on integrating smart helmets to  detect microsleep. For example, Shah et al. (2021) developed a smart helmet with a pulse sensor  connected to an Arduino to monitor the rider\\\'s heart rate. When   th e heart   rate falls below a set  threshold, the helmet vibrates to alert the rider, and if the drowsiness continues, an audio alert is  triggered. This research highlights the feasibility of using wearable technology in safety equipment to  monitor drowsiness   and prevent accidents. Other studies, such as by Kumar et al. (2023), introduced  smart helmets with alcohol detection and drowsiness monitoring, further demonstrating the potential  of integrating advanced sensing technologies to enhance rider safety.  Further research has also explored the use of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for detecting  driver fatigue. One study developed an ECG - equipped steering wheel that continuously monitors the\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861558  176  driver’s heart activity. The system utilizes the Pan - Tompkins algo rithm to analyze ECG signals and  distinguish between alert and drowsy states. This approach highlights the potential of ECG - based  monitoring in vehicles to improve safety by providing real - time alerts based on physiological data .  Similarly,   they   have explo red heart rate variability and heart rate fragmentation as methods to assess  cognitive fatigue in drivers   (Shah et al., 2021)   ( Kumar et al. 2023) .  In - vehicle physiological signal monitoring systems are another promising advancement. These  systems track var ious indicators of driver fatigue, such as heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV),  breathing patterns, and eye blinking frequency. A non - contact sensing platform, which can measure  ECG signals from a distance, is one such innovation. Tests on high - fideli ty driving simulators have  shown that this system can provide real - time alerts to drivers based on physiological signals, helping  to mitigate drowsiness - related accidents   (Gupta, Verma, & Choudhury, 2022) .   By analyzing heart rate  variations and blinking fr equency, these systems have shown promise in enhancing driver safety by  detecting fatigue early.  Another notable development is the \\\"Microsleep Detection Based on Arduino\\\" system, which  combines eye - blinking detection and heart rate monitoring. The system   uses a proximity sensor built  into glasses to track the driver’s eye movements and an impulse sensor on the fingertip to monitor heart  rate. This combination of behavioral and physiological measures provides a more accurate detection of  microsleep events,   with experimental results demonstrating a high accuracy rate of 96%. The Arduino -  based approach highlights the potential for creating cost - effective, user - friendly solutions for real - time  detection of driver fatigue ( Sun, Yu, Berilla, Liu, & Wu, 2011) . Stu dies by   Gupta, Verma, & Choudhury  ( 2022 ) have also demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating different detection methods to monitor  drowsiness.  3. 2   Devices   Connectivity at Different Distances  Figure 1 .   Tx and Rx Connectivity at Different Distances  Figure 1 shows t he graph evaluates the connectivity range between the T x   and R x   units, based  on 30 tests conducted for each distance. The results demonstrate effective communication within a  range of up to   2   meters , which aligns with the system’s intended use for drivers inside a vehicle.  Beyond this range, connectivity weakened, leading to delays or missed alerts. While the test was limited\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861558  177  to 2 meters to simulate a vehicle\\\'s interior environment, the data i dentified   0.5 meters   as the optimal  distance for consistent and reliable performance. This finding confirms the system\\\'s suitability for close -  range applications in confined spaces like vehicles.  3. 3   Notification Upon Low   Heartbeat   Detection  Figure 2 .   Email   Received Upon Low Heart Beat Detection  Figure 2   illustrates the system’s email notification feature, which sent alerts when a low heart  rate was detected. Out of 66 successful connections between the transmitter (T x ) and receiver (R x ) from  120 tests conducted (30 test for each distances), 51 emails were successfully sent, demonstrating an  email success rate of approximately 77%. This result underscores the reliability of the email alert  mechanism in notifying users, even when they are not a ctively monitoring the mobile application. The  feature provides an additional layer of security and ensures that users are promptly alerted in critical  situations.  3. 4   Successful Rate of IoT  Figure 3 .

The results show that the system achieved a connectivity success rate exceeding 75% under stable  network   conditions.   This   performance   reflects   the   system\\\'s   capability   t o   facilitate   reliable  communication between the T x   and R x   devices. However, delays and failures were observed in areas\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861558  178  with weak internet connectivity, emphasizing the need for improved connectivity protocols or  alternative communication methods to ensure   uninterrupted operation.  4. DISCUSSION  The IoT - enabled drowsy driver alert system significantly contributes to road safety by  effectively addressing the risks associated with microsleep, a leading cause of drowsy driving  accidents. Experimental results cl early demonstrated its effectiveness as a cost - efficient solution to  reduce these incidents, highlighting its practicality and relevance in real - world applications. The  integration of the MAX30102 heart rate sensor played a crucial role, reliably monitorin g heart rate  changes and triggering immediate alerts such as the buzzer and diffuser. These features ensured users  received timely notifications during critical moments, which helped maintain focus and enhance  overall safety. However, occasional false alar ms due to insignificant heart rate fluctuations underline  the need for more precise sensor calibration and algorithm optimization to further improve accuracy  and reduce unnecessary interruptions.  In addition, the email alert system proved to be an essentia l feature, adding another layer of  security by sending notifications when low heart rates were detected. Out of 66 successful connections  between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), 51 email notifications were successfully delivered,  resulting in a 77%   success rate. This feature proved especially beneficial when the driver was not  actively monitoring the app, although occasional delivery issues suggest a need for improvement in  ensuring more consistent and reliable email transmission.  Furthermore, the   system’s IoT connectivity demonstrated a commendable performance with  over a 75% success rate in alert transmission between the T x   and R x   units under stable internet  conditions. However, delays and interruptions in areas with weak connectivity were observe d,  suggesting that exploring alternative communication methods, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),  could improve performance and robustness in low - network environments.  Connectivity range testing revealed that the system operated efficiently within a 2 - me ter range,  with optimal performance achieved at 0.5 meters. This aligns well with the typical dimensions of a  vehicle interior, validating the system’s practicality for in - vehicle use. The compact and portable design  of both the T x   and R x   units ensures eas e of integration into vehicles, even for users with limited  technical expertise. While the system demonstrates strong potential, there are areas for further  refinement. These include optimizing the heart rate sensor to minimize false positives and upgradin g  connectivity protocols   to   enhance performance   in   weak   network conditions.   Addressing   these  improvements will undoubtedly enhance the system\\\'s reliability, ensuring consistent and seamless  performance in everyday driving scenarios, ultimately making it a   more effective tool for enhancing  driver safety.  In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates the potential of an IoT - based system for  detecting and addressing microsleep in drivers, leveraging heart rate monitoring and essential oil  diffusion to   enhance road safety. By providing a cost - effective, non - intrusive solution that detects signs  of fatigue in real time, the system offers a practical alternative to existing methods. Its effectiveness in  alerting drivers to drowsiness and improving focus al igns with the project\\\'s goal of reducing accidents  caused by driver fatigue. Ultimately, the system contributes to safer roads by offering a simple yet  reliable tool to combat the dangers of microsleep.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861558  179  5. CONCLUSION  In conclusion, this project successfu lly achieved its goal of developing an effective IoT - based  microsleep detection system, contributing significantly to road safety by addressing the risks of driver  fatigue. The system demonstrated outstanding functionality, reliability, and real - world appl icability in  mitigating microsleep - related risks.  The integration of IoT technology allowed for real - time monitoring through the Blynk app, and  the communication between the T x   and R x   units was seamless. With a connectivity success rate  exceeding 75% under   stable conditions, the system ensured that alerts were delivered promptly and  accurately, critical for preventing accidents caused by drowsiness.  The MAX30102 heart rate sensor reliably detected low heart rates, associated with fatigue, and  triggered aler ts effectively,   underlining the importance of accurate physiological monitoring in  enhancing safety. The essential oil diffuser feature in the receiver unit further helped by providing a  non - intrusive method to refresh and alert the driver, improving overa ll alertness and reducing the risk  of fatigue - related incidents.  Testing confirmed that the system performed effectively within a 2 - meter range, validating its  suitability for use in vehicle interiors, making it practical for real - world applications. Howev er, some  challenges were encountered, such as occasional false alarms due to minor fluctuations in heart rate  and occasional delays in connectivity due to weak network environments. These challenges highlight  the need for improvements in sensor calibration   to increase accuracy and more robust connectivity  protocols to ensure consistent performance in less - than - ideal conditions.  For future studies, several improvements can be made to enhance the system’s effectiveness.  These include refining the heart rate s ensor to reduce false positives, exploring more reliable  communication methods, such as Bluetooth Low Energy or other alternatives, to ensure performance  in low - network environments, and expanding the system\\\'s scope to other domains like workplaces or  high - risk occupations where alertness is critical. Additionally, more extensive testing in different real -  world settings could provide deeper insights into the system’s versatility and performance under  varying conditions.  In summary, while the IoT - enabled   drowsy driver alert system has proven to be a reliable and  practical solution for enhancing road safety, further optimization and expansion of its applications  could make it an even more valuable tool in addressing fatigue - related accidents across various   sectors.

Abstract:   Essay writing has been a problem for Malaysian students as English is a second and even a third language  for majority of our students.   Since students nowadays are digital nomads, there is a need to use a more creative  approach in teaching essay writing.   One of them is through the use of Generative AI such as ChatGPT, Gemini and  Copilot.   Although artificial intelligence has been used by teachers and students, there is no proper guidelines in  using it.   Many teachers and students are still struggling to u se AI for their daily activities.   Thus, Bard G is a  teaching technique developed by the researchers in guiding students to use Gemini AI in their essay writing. Bard  G consists of a short video, two modules and a rainbow chart.   In this study, 40 Form 3   students were chosen as  respondents for this study. Based on Bard G, students can use Gemini easily without much guidance from teacher.  Bard G consists of prompts, illustrations and step - by step explanations on how to use Gemini for essay writing.   The  T - test conducted   on the use of Bard G in students’ essay writing   shows that students had improved significantly  through   the use of Bard G.   On top of that, students   had   also showed favourable responses towards the use of Bard  G in assisting them in   using Ge mini for t heir essay writing.   Finally, the use of Bard G enables students to learn  essay writing using Gemini AI easily and in an interesting way.

INTRODUCTION  Writing is one of the most difficult language   skills to acquire because writing consists of many  elements such as word choice, language use and spelling (Siddek & Ismail, 2021; Minn et al. 2019 and  Rahman et al., 2020). The main problems faced by students in their essay writing include the inability  to form grammatically accurate sentences and generalization of ideas due to poor command of  vocabulary and interference from their mother tongue (Siddek & Ismail, 2021).   Due to lack of time,  lack of facilities and poor command of the English language, maj ority of our English teachers usually  employ teacher - centred method in teaching essay writing (Gustiani, 2020 and Chun & Yunus, 2023).  Thus, there should be a call for a more creative approach in teaching essay writing such as through the  use of Artificia l Intelligence (Alharbi 2023; Buriak et al; Quintans - Junior et al. and Kim, 2023).  Although AI has long existed since 1950, it has only made tremendous impact in education field  since the emergence of ChatGPT. Similar to ChatGPT,   Gemini   is able to general ise information from a  large corpus of data built in it.   Research shows that   Gemini   can help with creative tasks, explaining  complex topics and generally extracting information from a variety of sources on the internet.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861594  188  Although studies had been carried   out about ChatGPT, there are a few studies on the use of other AI  tools especially among secondary school students (Aydın & Karaarslan, 2022; Jen & Salam, 2024;  Rahman et al., 2023; and Libório et al., 2023).   Moreover, there is lack of guidance in using   A I such   as  Gemini. Thus, this has discouraged teachers and students to explore further in the field of AI.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  In this study, Bard G   is a teaching technique   developed   in   guiding students to use Gemini AI  for   essay writing . It consists of a short video, two modules and a rainbow chart. The first book is for  beginner. It consists of explanation and illustrations about Gemini while the second book consists of  step - by - step explanation in guiding students to use Gemini in al l the three stages of essay writing: Pre -  writing, while writing and post - writing. The second book also consists of translation in Bahasa Melayu  to guide the weaker students in using Gemini for essay writing.   In addition, the rainbow chart is  developed to guide students to use Gemini more easily and in a faster way.   It consists of only the  prompts used in the three stages of essay writing. Below is the rainbow chart used in this study.  Figure   1:   Rainbow   Chart  3 . FINDINGS  3.1   Findings from T - Test  40 students of a secondary school in Johor Bahru   were chosen as the respondents to examine  the effectiveness of Bard G in improving students’ essay writing skills. A paired sample t - test was  conducted to compare the pre - test and post test scores of the experimental group.   The experimental  group was the   students who went through the essay writing class using Bard G. The results revealed  a significant difference between the pre - test and post - test results as the p - value was less than 0.05. These  findings suggest that we have to reject the null hypotheses   as students had improved significantly  through the use of Bard G in their essay writing.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861594  189  3.2   Findings from Students’ Journal Entries  All the 40 students were asked to write down their perceptions regarding the use of Bard G  after the essay writing lesso ns. Below are the students’ responses analysed using thematic approach.     Student 1 :   With Bard G, we can use AI easily.     Student 3 :   We can learn new words through Bard G.     Student 4 :   Bard G is easy to use even for a 10 - year - old kid.  3 .3   Findings from   Questionnaires  The questionnaires administered to the respondents in the study showed that all of them  expressed that they liked using Bard G. This is because Bard G   was   easy to use.   Apart from that, 95%  of the students stated that they had improved their essay writing using Bard G and all of them stated  that they had learnt new vocabulary and ideas from Bard G. This was termed as ‘perceived usefulness’  in the TAM Theory. Venkatesh e t al (2003) asserted that, perceived usefulness is defined as the extent  to which using a system enhances an individual’s productivity. Bard G does not only help students in  using Gemini easily, but   generation of ideas, but also helps them to translate wo rds from their mother  tongue into suitable words in their essay writing.  3.4   Findings from Observation  It was observed that all the students   could learn how to use Gemini easily   using Bard G. They  even ventured further on their own by using   Gemini   for their other writing tasks.   However, it was  observed that not all the students were given equal opportunities in using   Gemini   and time was limited  for students to explore using   Gem ini .   To overcome this problem, students were asked to continue  surfing for online materials using   Gemini   at home since most of them had either mobile phones or  laptops at home.  3 .5   Findings from Semi - Structured Interview  The focus group interviews conducted with the students showed that all of them liked to use  Bard G . This was because Bard G was something new for them. Bard G also has many other benefits  as highlighted by the students.  Firstly, Bard   G helped students to   know the appropriate way to   generate ideas for their essays  using Gemini . Students were only required to enter the keywords into the ‘prompt’ for the essay task  and   Gemini   would generate a lot of content in paragraphs for them. Apar t from that,   students   had also  improved   their   vocabulary as students could key in words in their mother tongue into the system.  Gemini   would then translate the given word into a few suggested English words with explanation.  Through this, students had not   only learnt about the new words, but they had also learnt the meaning  of the new words provided by   Gemini .   Finally,   Gemini   had also improved students’ reading  comprehension and pronunciation through the ‘Read Along’ feature provided in the text.   Once  ac tivated, the ‘Read Along’ feature in   Gemini   would read out all the words shown in the   Gemini .  Students would be able to learn about the correct pronunciation of every word and at the same time  understood the text better since they were not only using thei r sight sensory but they were using their  listening sensory at the same time.  Finally, all the students stated that they did not face any problem while using   Gemini . This is  because Bard G   provided step - by - step guidance in using Gemini.   Students were o nly required to key  in the keywords into the ‘prompt’ function   as shown in the rainbow chart   and the responses would be  given by   Gemini in a split second . Thus, students did not face any problem while using Bard G. This\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861594  190  ‘perceived ease of use’ feature of   Bard G enables it to be used easily and conveniently (Venkatesh et al.,  2003).  4 . CONCLUSION  In conclusion, Bard G is a great aid for students   in using Gemini   to improve their writing  performance.   This is supported by studies done by Guo   et al. (2022) and Nazari et al. (2021) who  asserted that Artificial Intelligence tools have great benefits in improving students’ essay writing  performance. This is because apart from generating ideas, Artificial Intelligence tools are also able to  perfo rm other functions such as translation, providing feedback, evaluating students’ essays and give  personalised comments to the users.   Future research should be carried out regarding the use of Bard  G with different age groups   apart from Form 3 students.  References  Alharbi, W. (2023).

However, such rapidity in the proliferation of QR code - based transactions  has thoroughly exposed the users to innu merable perils from the perspective of cybersecurity: phishing scams,  malware distribution, data breaches, etc. The present paper, therefore, discusses a robust verification application for  QR code verification, capable of mitigating these loopholes to pro vide extra security regarding digital transactions.  It uses the latest verification mechanisms in identifying and neutralizing malicious links while remaining within  the bounds of Malaysia\\\'s Personal Data Protection Act. User - friendly and with the most str ingent security  measures, this invention creates trust and confidence in the use of QR - based payment systems to further the larger  goals of Malaysia in its efforts to develop its digital economy.

INTRODUCTION  This has been a continuous development toward efficiency and safety in means of   paying over  centuries, from barter systems to coin - based transactions, fiat currencies, and up to digital payments.  Each development tried to overcome the limitations of the previous one and meet the emergent needs  of society. During the last couple of dec ades, digital payment systems have gained prominence because  of their speed, convenience, and global accessibility. QR codes, as a component of this evolution, have  become a ubiquitous feature of modern payment ecosystems, streamlining transactions across   retail,  logistics, and service industries (Shaari, 2020). Their integration into daily life underscores the  importance of ensuring their secure usage.  While QR codes have revolutionized payment processes, they also present new security  challenges. These ma licious actors utilize the vulnerabilities in QR code technology to perpetrate  cybercrimes such as phishing scams, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and malware distribution.  For example, fake QR codes can redirect users to fraudulent websites or init iate downloads of harmful\r\n\r\nAPS   Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861602  193  software that compromise the security of their devices. As noted by Lani et al. (2018), these risks raise  an urgent need for robust verification mechanisms to protect users and restore trust in QR - based  systems.  In Malaysia, the p roliferation of QR codes is closely related to the nation\\\'s push for digital  transformation under initiatives such as the Malaysian Digital Economy Blueprint, MyDIGITAL. Such  initiatives aim at improving digital infrastructure and fostering innovation that   positions Malaysia as  a regional leader in the digital economy. Radzi et al. (2023). However, all these initiatives have been  possible only with the proper mitigation of cybersecurity - related issues, highly essential in any widely  used technology, includi ng QR codes. Ensuring that digital transactions are safe will be critical to  building consumer confidence and allowing the digital payment sector to realize sustainable growth.  This research tries to fill this gap in cybersecurity with a novel QR code veri fication application.  By utilizing such advanced technologies and aligning with Malaysia\\\'s PDPA, this solution will help  minimize risks and enhance the security of QR - based transactions. Findings from this study will  contribute to academic discourses on di gital payment security   and   offer practical recommendations for  policy makers, businesses, and technology developers committed to developing a safer digital  ecosystem.  2. METHOD & MATERIAL  2.1   App Features  The proposed QR code verification application will   be designed with several important  features intended to address the vulnerabilities associated with QR - based transactions. First, it contains  an advanced verification mechanism that scans and authenticates QR codes for malicious links that  may lead to una uthorized access to sensitive information. This feature will ensure that users can  confidently engage with QR codes, knowing that potential threats have been identified and neutralized.  All these will be put into consideration with the app, ensuring secure   registration where personal  information is encrypted to make the system more secure. It\\\'s also accessible on major platforms like  the Apple Store and Google Play, guaranteeing wide adoption across demographics. These features put  together make the applica tion a comprehensive solution to QR code usage with respect to cybersecurity  challenges.  2.2   User Workflow  The user workflow is streamlined to ensure ease of use and maximum efficiency. To begin,  users can download the application from their preferred plat form store. Once installed, they are guided  through a secure registration process that establishes their account and verifies their credentials.  Following registration, users can utilize the app to scan QR codes before initiating payments or  accessing link s. This proactive scanning process alerts users to potential threats, such as phishing  attempts or malware - laden URLs, thereby preventing harm before it occurs. The workflow is designed  to integrate seamlessly into the daily routines of users, making it an   indispensable tool for anyone  relying on QR codes for digital transactions.\r\n\r\nAPS   Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861602  194  3. FINDINGS  3.1 .   Problem Statement  Figure   1 .   User Workflow  The rapid use of QR codes for digital payment has exposed users to various security risks. Some  of the security issues that present themselves   include an increase in fraudulent QR codes that redirect  users to phishing websites designed to steal personal and financial information. Another important  concern in this regard has to do with malware or APK download via QR code that automatically can  com promise   the   mobile   device\\\'s   security.   In   addition   to   this,   because   fraudulent   QR   codes  impersonating serious organizations have increasingly come into prominence, people have slowly lost  their faith in the technology. These challenges highlight how importa nt it is to find a powerful solution  to bring users and confidence in QR - based transactions back.  2.3   Objectives  Basic aims of the project are an advanced QR code transaction security and a confidence  increase among its users. The application is supposed t o be a trusted first layer of protection - a warning  about possible risks and blocking access to information that is undesirable. It also intends to provide  extensive information about organizations or individuals issuing any QR code so a user could make an  informed decision based on that knowledge. It also involves the scanning of any payment links to  ensure that one can ascertain the legitimacy of the same before proceeding to transact. These goals are  in line with the bigger picture of ensuring safety and   security in digital payment practices.  2.4   SWOT Analysis  Figure   2 .   SWOT Analysis  Download app in phone  store  (Apple Store, Google  Play, etc.)  Complete  registration in the  app  Use the app before scan any  QR code that verify link, lead  to payment or   download  anything from QR\r\n\r\nAPS   Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861602  195  The SWOT analysis has brought out some key implications related to the QR code verification  application. The list of strengths includes the   enhancement in users\\\' trust and improvement in data  security; it is foreseen to be a useful application in this war against cybercrime. However, on the other  side, the project does have its possible weaknesses, such as high initial development costs and us er  resistance for not being tech - savvy. Opportunities for usage include collaborations with regulatory  bodies, such as SSM and the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), which might allow it to  be integrated with existing digital ecosystems. Threats   to such a solution include general unawareness  among users and possible competition to similar solutions that are already in the market. Addressing  these factors will help in realizing full benefits of the project and translate into large - scale adoption.  3 . DISCUSSION  3.1   Contribution of QR Code Verification  Recently, QR codes are easy to use, cost - effective, and widely used in industries like retail,  healthcare, and education. We believe when QR codes improvise with verification data, it will support  the   nation’s digital transformation by way of the following:  3.1.1   Enhancing Business Transparency  QR codes shall link to the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM)’s database to allow users  to instantly verify corporate information, such as company registrat ion details, business type, and  validity.   This   will   enhance   transparency,   enabling   businesses   and   consumers   to   confirm   the  establishment of companies and help prevent fraud.  3.1.2   Strengthening Cybersecurity Transaction  The implementation of QR codes with   verification shall prevent unauthorized access to  sensitive information, strengthen security, reduce cyber threats, and reduce the risk of phishing and  data breaches. This boosts confidence among businesses and consumers in using technology for secure  tran sactions.  3.1.3   Boost User Trust Through Personal Data Protection  QR codes with verification data must comply with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) to  ensure personal data protection and prevent misuse. The businesses also must disclose data collect ed  through QR code scanning, ensuring transparency in user consent. PDPA will establish a legal  framework to safeguard consumers\\\' personal information tied to QR codes.  3.2   Commercialization of QR Codes with Verification Data  QR code with verification dat a has potential for commercialization in the future based on the  followings:  3.2.1   Essential Data Protection for All Malaysians  The QR code with the verification product provides an essential solution for all Malaysians to  safeguard their confidential info rmation. In this new era of digitalization, data breaches and identity  theft by irresponsible individuals are common concerns. This product ensures that users\\\' personal data\r\n\r\nAPS   Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861602  196  remains secure by adding an extra layer of verification, protecting sensitive info rmation from  unauthorized access. It is an indispensable tool for anyone focused on data privacy.  3.2.2   Collaboration with Authority and Regulatory Bodies to Safeguard Data and Protect Users  By forming strategic partnerships and collaborating with authorit ies and regulatory bodies  such as SSM, CyberSecurity Malaysia, and the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), this  product can be integrated into existing systems. This ensures that both consumers and businesses  benefit from enhanced data security.   This collaboration will create a robust network of trust and  security, making it a vital component of modern business operations.  3.2.3   Expanding Barcode and Hologram Scanning for Product Authenticity  Furthermore, the product aims to expand its usage to in clude the scanning of barcodes and  holograms, ensuring the authenticity of products sold. This feature will be particularly beneficial in  combating counterfeit goods and protecting consumers from fraudulent products. By verifying the  authenticity of items   through QR codes and holograms, businesses can maintain their reputation for  quality and trustworthiness, while consumers can shop with confidence knowing that the products  they purchase are genuine and safe.  3.2.4   Penetrating International Markets  We have   seen that the QR code with the verification product has the potential to penetrate  markets outside of Malaysia. There is a demand on the needs for secure data protection and product  authentication; this product can offer valuable solutions to internationa l businesses and consumers. By  leveraging its proven success in Malaysia, the product can expand and establish itself as a trusted name  in data security and product verification worldwide, opening new opportunities for growth and  innovation.  4 . CONCLUSION  The development of a QR code verification application addresses several challenges at the core  of digital payment security. It would be an epoch - making solution that will ensure the safety and  reliability   of   QR - based   transactions   by   focusing   on   data   secur ity,   business   transparency,   and  compliance with PDPA. Equipped with innovative features in threat detection and organization  verification, it will serve as an avenue that will make end - users much more confident in their journey  to new terrain on the mobile   digital payment marketplace. Further efforts should continue to push  toward more collaboration from the regulating authorities for widespread adoptions of the app to  ensure success and impact on the digital economy, not just in Malaysia but across the oce an.

INTRODUCTION  limate   change is one of the most pressing global challenges, significantly affecting both human  life and the environment. According to the 2023 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC), global temperatures have risen by an average of 1.1° C since the pre - industrial era. This  increase has triggered devastating disasters such as floods, droughts, and rising sea levels. Addressing  these complex issues requires urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily caused by  the burning of   fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities — all of which contribute to the rising  concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAPS Proceedings Volume 19   | DOI:   10.5281/zenodo.14861 614  199  In   addition   to   mitigation   efforts,   adaptation   strategies   are   essential.   Strengthening  infrastructure   to   withstand   natural   disasters,   promoting   sustainable   agricultural   practices,   and  enhancing public literacy on climate change impacts and solutions are crucial steps. Effective climate  action demands collaboration among individuals, institutions, and governme nts to ensure that both  mitigation and adaptation strategies are implemented in a sustainable and efficient manner.  The primary   reason   of climate change is human activity, which significantly contributes to  greenhouse gas emissions. According to data from   the Global Carbon Project (2022), fossil fuel  combustion   contributes   approximately 87% of global CO₂ emissions. Additionally, deforestation —  especially in tropical regions like Indonesia — reduces the Earth’s capacity to absorb carbon naturally.  Unsustainable   industrial waste management and excessive use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture  further exacerbate the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These emissions accelerate  global warming, leading to climate instability across various regio ns of the world.  In general ,   t he   i m p a c t   of climate change   can   b e   seen from various perspective s , one of them is  the melting of polar ice caps .   This phenomenon   significantly contributes to rising sea levels ,   which   a r e  estimated   to increase by up to one meter by the end of the century (IPCC, 2021). Such changes pose a  direct threat to coastal ecosystems and communities that depend on them, particularly in island n ations  like   Indonesia .   In   addition ,   unpredictable rainfall patterns disrupt   global agricultural systems,  increasing the risk of droughts and floods .   Marine ecosystems are also under threat, with coral  bleaching serving as a stark example of how climate change   endangers biodiversity . Therefore ,   i t   i s  i mportant   to seek innovative solutions that raise public awareness and promote collective action.  I n   o r d e r   t o   o vercome   t h e   impact   o f   change climate   climate change effectively   requires cross -  sector collaboration ,   including efforts to   s t r e n g t h e n   public literacy   on environmental issues .   A well -  informed society is more likely to take meaningful action, such as reducing carbon footprints,  conserving natural resources , and adapting to climate risks .   One of   effective   method   t o   increase   p u b l i c  is through educational platforms based on digital technology .   However, a major challenge in climate  education is the accessibility   and effectiveness of available information. According to UNESCO (2022),  much of the information on climate change is either inaccurate, difficult to understand, or presented in  an unengaging manner. Additionally, most educational platforms tend to be pass ive, failing   to inspire  active participation , especially   f r o m   y o u n g   generation .  In response to this need, this study aims to develop an interactive Androi d application called  LETA (Literate and Educate Climate Change) .   Designed using Kodular and based on the ADDIE  Research and Development (R&D) model, LETA seeks to improve public literacy on climate change  through interactive features such as data visualiza tion, educational quizzes, and easy - to - understand  informational content.   By integrating environmental literacy with modern digital learning methods,  LETA aspires to be a relevant educational tool that enhances climate change awareness and encourages  collec tive action for a more sustainable future.  2.

SUBMITTED TO:  Dr. MARVIN O. MALLARI  APRIL 2025\r\n\r\n2  CHAPTER I  INTRODUCTION  Societal   life   has   progressively   witnessed   the   failure   of   individuals\\\'   discipline, expressed in the increasing disrespect for elders, authority,   and above all in the environme nt. Littering   has become a major issue, with small pieces of waste being randomly   thrown in public places, water bodies, and coastal regions, leading to environmental degradation. This growing   problem highlights   the need for proper waste management   measures   to promote environmental responsibility and ensure sustainable practices. Up to 63,700 tons of plastic, or equivalent of more than 10,600 elephants\\\' weight, are dumped into the ocean annually by the Pasig River. (Arcega, 2017)  Littering is also remains one of the most persisting environmental problems in present  society. Improper waste disposal on streets, into water streams, or public places creates dangers for human   health   as well as ecosystems.   Awareness   campaigns   and policies   targeted   at reducing littering do not seem to help because of the absence of discipline and understand ing by individuals.   Discarded plastic bottles and paper bags clutter the roadsides everywhere,  pointing toward   the   need   to   find   innovative   ways   to   solve   such   problems.   “ The increasing   mismanagement   of plastic   waste has resulted   in serious   environmental   impacts, emphasizing the necessity for better waste collection and classification systems. (Jambeck, et  al., 2015)”  Modern technologies   have opened doors to more systematic   and efficient   ways of managing   waste.   Among   these   technologies,   automation   is   promising   in   addressing\r\n\r\n3  environmental   challenges.   Automated   systems   can streamline   the collection   and sorting of waste, reduce reliance   on human   intervention,   and significantly   improve   the efficiency   of waste management   operations.   Robotics   stands out as a transformative   solution   with   the potential to redefine how societies approach waste disposal.   Our research was conceived as a reaction to the recurrent problems of waste management, specifically the ineffectiveness of waste segregation,   collection,   and disposal. Conventional waste management   processes use manual   methods,   which   are not only   time-intensive   but also   subject to inaccuracies   in classifying the wastes. Knowing these setbacks, we aimed to create an intelligent, automated system that would improve   the efficiency of waste management systems. This gap led us to conceptualize   TrashyBot;   a smart, AI-based waste collection   and segregation   system that employs image processing for precise classification.  TrashyBot works through a blend of AI-powered image processing, sensors, and an automated robotic system. The device comes with a USB Camera that takes photos of the trash objects, and they are processed via a software (TensorFlow) to identify the type of trash. After identification,   the robotic arm or collection   system separates the trash into separate compartments.\r\n\r\n4  Background of the Study  Waste disposal has long been a significant environmental issue globally. Traditional  methods like landfilling,   open dumping,   and incineration,   while widely used, often result in   severe   environmental   and   health   complications.   The   increasing   urbanization   and population   growth exacerbate the inefficiency   of these approaches in managing   modern waste challenges.   Although green practices such as recycling,   composting,   and advanced waste segregation technologies   have emerged, they still face major drawbacks, includ ing inefficiencies   in waste segregation,   reliance   on manual processes prone to errors, and the absence   of real-time   monitoring.   To   address   these   limitations,   the   study   introduces TrashyBot, an innovative waste management system aimed at automating waste detection, classification,   and segregation   using   AI-based image   processing.   TrashyBot   classifies waste into biodegradable, non-biodegradable, recyclable and hazardous types and includes features   such   as   autonomous   movement.   By   integrating   automation   with   intellige nt technologies,   TrashyBot seeks to improve current waste management systems\\\' efficie nc y while providing scalable solutions for urban waste issues.  At the Barangay of San Nicolas Sta Ana Pampang, improper waste segregation and the  absence   of an efficient,   modernized   waste   disposal   system   have   led   to challenges   in maintaining   cleanliness   and   environmental   sustainability   on barangay.   Waste   is   often disposed   of without   proper sorting,   reducing   the   potential   for   effective   recycling   and increasing the risk of health hazards. This study will deploy TrashyBot within the barangay  as a localized   solution   to these problems.   It will   evaluate   the system’s   effectiveness   in\r\n\r\n5  automating   waste classification   and improving overall waste management   practices in the institution.   Additionally,   it aims to enhance   environmental   awareness among students by demonstrating   how technology   can play   a crucial   role   in   sustainability   efforts   within academic settings.  The   research   is   supported   by   existing   literature   highlighting   robotics,   AI,   and sensorbased technologies   in enhancing   waste management.   Studies such as those by Liu, Zhang,   & Chen   (2020) and Shi & Zhang (2018) emphasize   automation\\\'s   role in waste recognition and collection. Research by Bahrami & Abolhasani (2017), Jang & Park (2020), and Shirode & Mehta (2019) underscore the efficiency and environmental benefits of robotic systems for waste segregation and collection. Additional studies, including those by Reyes & Santos (2019) and Mendoza & Ramos (2018), focus on improving   recycling   levels   and reducing landfill reliance through automated technologies.  Further analyses, such as those by Yao & Li (2021) and Tan (2020), emphasize robotics\\\'  contribution   to sustainability and urban waste collection efficiency.   Studies by De la Cruz (2019) and Rodriguez & Enriquez (2018) underline the environmental advantages of robotic  systems, aligning closely with TrashyBot’s   objectives. However, chal lenges   like improper waste   disposal   behaviors   remain,   as noted   by Raphela,   Manqele,   & Erasmus   (2024). TrashyBot aims to bridge gaps by combining   classification,   and detection promoting   both technological and behavioral advancements   in waste management.   The literature   validates TrashyBot\\\'s   innovation   in   integrating   AI,   robotics,   and   intelligent   technologies   for comprehensive, real-time waste management solutions. The system represents a scalable and\r\n\r\n6  efficient approach to modern waste challenges,   promoting   environmental sustainability and reducing manual dependency.  Statement of the Problem  This study aims to develop of an \\\"intelligent   robot\\\" called \\\"TrashyBot,\\\" designed   to collect and correctly categorize   waste.

The scope of the study includes:  Scope  Waste Classification : “TrashyBot”   is capable of identifying,   collecting,   and classifying  waste   into   four   categories:   biodegradable,   non-biodegradable,   hazardous   waste   and recyclable. It is capable of holding waste weighing up to 2kg, with a height of 10 inches and a length of 6 inches. Equipped with   “ USB Camera for Raspberry Pi” product in combinatio n  with image   processing   technology   based on TensorFlow   for deep learning-based   waste classification .  Waste Collection : The robot includes   a built-in   compartment   to store collected   trash, enabling efficient waste operation.  Compartment   Capacity:   TRASHYBOT handling during is about 10 inches tall and has a diameter of 6 inches for its trash can. The trash compartment can hold approximately 10kg of waste before requiring disposal.  Testing and Evaluation : “TrashyBot” will be tested in selected public areas, such as  schools and other public areas, to evaluate its ability to detect, collect, and segregate waste.\r\n\r\n9  Delimitation  Type of Waste : “TrashyBot” focuses on common solid waste such as plastic bottles, paper,  and other lightweight materials.  Environment : The robot will be tested in accessible environments, such as parks, sidewalks, and indoor public spaces. It may not perform optimally in rough terrains, crowded areas, or locations with excessive debris.  Operational   Range : The   robot\\\'s performance   is restricted   by its battery life   and trash compartment capacity, limiting its operational time and the amount of trash it can collect in  a single   run. TRASHYBOT’s waste collection capacity is limited   to   5kg per compartment, requiring periodic disposal.  Weather Conditions : “TrashyBot” is designed to funct ion in dry conditions. It may not be tested for use in rainy or extreme weather conditions, as moisture can affect its sensors and electronics.\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n11  The study on \\\"TrashyBot: An Intelligent Trash-Picking Robot with Waste Classification Features\\\" uses the IPO model to demonstrate its flow and development.The input stage of the conceptual framework for TrashyBot entails collecting necessary components, tools, and information needed to design the system. The stage sets the stage for the project by specifying the required hardware, software, and initial data gathering approaches.  Among   the key elements   in this   stage is the determination   of waste classificatio n groups.   Correct   groupings   are   key   to   ensuring   proper   identificatio n   and   sorting   of biodegradable, nonbiodegradable,   and recyclable   items. This process enables TrashyBot to operate   well   in   identifying   various   types   of wastes   and   disposing   them accordingly. Hardware   needs wise,   the project involves   different   modules   that   allow   TrashyBot   to function optimally. A Raspberry Pi acts as the main processor, processing data from camera and running AI models. The wastebasket gives space for allotted portions of organized trash, and proper disposal   takes place.   There   is   a physical   pickup   and segregation   of trash components using a robot claw gripper and an imaging camera taking a snapshot of materia ls as waste in real-time processing via AI-powered algorithms. The software specifications are important for facilitating the smart capability of TrashyBot. TensorFlow, which is a machine learning   library,   is used in AI-powered image recognition   and garbage classification.   The NumPy numerical computing library is necessary for the processing of image data. These software   facilities   altogether   improve   waste   classification   and separation   accuracy   and speed.\r\n\r\n12  In   addition,   surveys   and   interviews   are   carried   out   to   gain   input   from   major stakeholders,   such   as students,   custodial   staff,   and   school administrators.   These   data gathering   processes assist in learning about waste disposal behaviors, determining system needs, and perfecting the design and operation of TrashyBot. The input received helps ensure that the project is compatible   with the needs of the users and increases its applicability   in real life.  Agile   is an adaptive and iterative   software and hardware development   methodology that   guarantees   constant   improvement   and   adjustment.   TRASHYBOT\\\'s   development adheres   to the   Agile   Methodology,   more   precisely   using   the   Scrum   methodology   to effectively develop and improve   the system. Below is a summary of how agile phases are relevant to TRASHYBOT:  The   Planning Phase   involves gathering requirements   and identifying the robot\\\'s key functionalities,   such   as waste   detection,   sorting,   and   collection,   while   setting   project objectives. In the   Designing Phase , the system architecture, hardware, and software design are developed. This includes creating the robotic structure, selecting appropriate sensors for trash   detection,   and   defining   the   AI-powered   image   processing   system.   During   the  Development Phase , hardware   components   are manufactured   and assembled,   and the software is built. The AI-driven waste classification system are programmed and integrated into TRASHYBOT to enable real-time   automation.   In the   Testing Phase , TRASHYBOT undergoes thorough functionality tests. Key features like sensors, AI-powered waste sorting,\r\n\r\n13  and autonomous navigation are evaluated for accuracy, efficiency, and reliability under real- world conditions, such as those in a school campus. The   Deployment Phase   follows, where the robot is implemented in designated areas for practical use. Finally, in the   Review Phase , performance   data is collected,   and user feedback is analyzed.   Enhancements   are made to address issues such as waste sorting accuracy, battery performance,   and mobility, ensuring continuous improvement through iterative updates.  The output is a fully functional TrashyBot that can address improper waste disposal. The robot is designed   to detect and collect   trash from various   environments,   accurately classify waste into biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable categories, and store it in its built-in   compartment.   This innovative   solution aims to improve   waste manageme nt practices and contribute to environmental sustainability.  Synthesis  Various studies have emphasized   the role of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and sensor-based technology   in streamlining   the efficiency   of waste management.   The use of advanced sensors and AI in waste collection operations allows for effective identification and collection   of   litter   in   open   spaces,   which   enhances   the   operations   of waste   disposal. Furthermore, the use of sensor-based intelligent trash cans optimizes   waste handling through real-time   waste monitoring   and automation   of collection.   Such studies   suggest   increasing relevance of automation in modern trash disposal to suit   TrashyBot\\\'s   mission in the form of real-time   detection   and AI-separated waste collection   to   ensure proper   management   of\r\n\r\n14  wastes.   Also aiding the employment of robotics in the management of trash, robot collectio n systems   of waste not only streamline   operations   but reduce human   interaction   with toxic elements   as   well.   Independent   trash-gathering   robots   maximize   efficiency   and   reduce employee   costs. Waste segregation can also be improved by robot systems   that sort waste into biodegradable,   recyclable,   and non-recyclable   material.   This   information   is directly related to the objective of TrashyBot,   which also employs   AI- based image   processing for accurate classification of waste with minimal reliance on   manual sorting.  Several studies   have also examined   the effect of automation   on waste sorting and recycling. Automated waste sorting technologies   can enhance recycling rates, particularly in urban regions. Robotic technology supports efficient waste sorting and landfill reduction in urbanized regions. The use of robotic waste management systems can enhance the efficie nc y of the system while   minimizing   the environmental   effects   of urban waste disposal.   Such studies resoundingly support TrashyBot\\\'s gap, with current city waste management remaining inefficient in the real-time watching and automatic segregation that TrashyBot intends to offer through AIdriven waste sorting.  In addition,   robotic garbage management and value for sustainability have also been subject to various   research studies.   Robot systems   are especially   important   in helping   to prevent the contamination of garbage and promoting value for sustainability. The potential for robotic integration   in urban waste collection   provides greater   efficiency.   Automation   and robotic   technologies   in   smart   waste   management   can efficiently   increase   urban   waste\r\n\r\n15  collection and sorting. Automated waste management systems help in keeping cities cleaner and in more efficient   waste management   policies.   These researches   affirm   the need for automated   waste   collection   systems,   which   TrashyBot   directly   answers   through   the automation of waste detection, collection, and sorting.  However,   despite   the creation   of automated   waste disposal,   poor waste disposal remains   an environmental   problem of concern. Poor waste disposal still   causes pollutio n, environmental contamination, and health risks. While other research is focused primarily on automation and robotics of waste collection and sorting, TrashyBot pioneers one step further by bridging the gap from classification and detection of waste. Besides streamlining waste collection,   this   is   accomplished   while   actually   engaging   users   in proper waste disposal practices, thus addressing both the technological and behavioral aspects of waste manageme nt. In short, the current literature   has extensively   explored the use of AI, robotics, and smart technologies in waste management. Nevertheless, there are gaps in fully integrated , real-time, and interactive   waste disposal systems. TrashyBot expands this literature by offering   a full solution that combines AI-driven waste sensing, real-time sorting, autonomous   mobility, and smart notifications, which renders it an extremely   adaptable   and scalable   system for modern waste management issues.\r\n\r\n16  Definition of Terms  Automation   - It refers to the TrashyBot\\\'s   ability to autonomously detect, classify, and collect trash without requiring constant manual control.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)   - It is utilized   for image   processing and waste classification   of TrashyBot ,   enabling   the   system   to   identify   and   categorize   waste   as   biodegradable, nonbiodegradable, or recyclable.

The researchers  adopted survey questionnaire which consists of five- point Likert Scale that fits the research. The researchers gave the questionnaires   to 15 respondents to obtain the data needed. Mean and frequency were included in descriptive statistics.  Summary of Findings  The   Modern   society   has   increasingly   struggled   with   a   decline   in   individ ua l discipline,   evident   in the rising   disregard   for elders, authority,   and, most notably,   the environment.   Littering   has emerged   as a significant   concern,   with   small   waste items carelessly   discarded   in   public   spaces,   waterways,   and   coastal   areas, contributing   to environmental deterioration. This escalating issue underscores the importance of effective waste   management   strategies   to   encourage   environmental   responsibility   and   support sustainable   practices. The main objective   of this study was to design and develop of a TRASHYBOT a system that allows users and offers a more user-friendly, time-saving, and accessible   method of waste management   especially   was validated   using   the ISO25010 quality   attributes   of a expert in hardware and software. Among the attributes   assessed, interaction   capacity recorded the highest   weighted   mean, indicating that the system can fulfill its functional suitability, performance efficiency, usability they both receive the mean\r\n\r\n49  “2.67”, then portability receive mean “2.50”, but the lowest is the reliability receive mean “2.00”, and the highest compatibility receive mean “3.00”.  Additionally,   the system was evaluated by the local of barangay San Nicolas Sta Ana Pampanga   using   the functional   suitability,   performance   efficiency,   usability,   portability, reliability,   and compatibility.   The   system recorded the overall   weighted   mean score of TRASHYBOT is 3.33 all corresponding to a descriptive rating of \\\"Neutral\\\". These findings indicate that TRASHYBOT is highly effective in delivering functionality, convenience, and a positive experience, successfully addressing the inefficiencies found in waste manageme nt methods.  CONCLUSIONS  After the conduct of the study, the researcher concluded that:  1.   TRASHYBOT operates minimal human   intervention,   reducing   labor requireme nts and enhancing the waste management operations.  2.   TRASHYBOT   classifies   waste   into   recyclable,   hazardous,   non-recyclable,   and biodegradable   categories using AI-powered image processing.   The approach shows that image processing is a practical way to enhance waste management classificatio n, even   though   there   are   certain   accuracy   restrictions   because   of   lighting,   item resemblance, or camera angles.\r\n\r\n50  3.   The researchers not successfully   achieved   the general objective   of designing   and  developing   “TrashyBot:   An   Intelligent   Trash -Picking   Robot   with   Waste  Classification”,   because of the time   and is not entirely   functional   due to cer tain components being damaged or burned.  RECOMMENTIONS  Based on the findings   and conclusions   of the   study,   the following   recommendations   are proposed:  1.   It is recommended to redesign the machine with a more modern, attractive, and aesthetic appearance to appeal to a broader audience and create a more inviting user experience in public areas.  2.   It is   recommended   to efficiency   the   image   processing   so that will   work perfectly to see the trash.  3.   Increase System Usability and User-Friendliness. The sy stem’s operability and  ease of interaction should be improved by developing a simple user interface or mobile application that allows users to monitor and control the robot easily. Clear instructions and user feedback systems can also help reduce user errors and enhance the overall experience.\r\n\r\n51  References  Alshaikh,   R., & Abdelfatah,   A. (2024).
